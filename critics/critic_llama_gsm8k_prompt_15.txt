(130, ' Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue, with a probability of ###0.8###.\nExplanation:\nThe initial number of elves hired by Nissa was 60, and a third of them quit after being vomited on, which is 20 elves. Then, 10 more elves quit after being kicked by children, which is an additional 10 elves. Therefore, the final number of elves left is 10.\nThe probability of each elf quitting can be calculated using the binomial distribution, which is:\nP(X=x) = (n!)(p)^x(1-p)^(n-x)\nwhere X is the number of elves who quit, n is the initial number of elves hired (60), p is the probability of each elf quitting (0.2 for vomit, and 0.1 for kicks), and x is the number of elves who quit due to each reason.\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the probability of each elf quitting due to vomit and kicks:\nP(vomit) = (60!)(0.2)^20(0.8)^40 = 0.06\nP(kicks) = (60!)(0.1)^10(0.8)^50 = 0.02\nTherefore, the total probability of all elves quitting is:\nP(all elves quit) = P(vomit) + P(kicks) = 0.06 + 0.02 = 0.08\nSo, the probability that all elves quit is 0.08, or ###0.08###.\nHowever, since not all elves quit, the probability that at least one elf remains is:\nP(at least one elf remains) = 1 - P(all elves quit) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92, or ###0.92###.\nTherefore, the final answer is True, with a probability of ###')

(142, " Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue, but with a probability of ###0.7###.\nExplanation:\nThe calculation for the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working is correct. If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, he has 14 hours of free time each day that he could use to work. At $10 per hour, he would earn $140 per day. Therefore, in one week, he would earn $1000.\nHowever, there is an opportunity cost associated with Jordan's video game time. By playing games instead of working, he misses out on the potential income he could have earned had he worked during that time. Using the concept of marginal utility, we can estimate the opportunity cost of each hour of video game time. If Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, the marginal utility of each additional hour of work is $10. Therefore, the opportunity cost of each hour of video game time is $10. Multiplying this by the number of hours Jordan spends playing games per week, we get $140 in opportunity cost.\nAdding this to the earnings from working, Jordan would earn a total of $1140 in one week.\nSo, while the calculation for the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working is correct, there is an opportunity cost associated with his video game time that reduces his overall earnings.

(988, " Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue, with a probability of ###0.75###.\nExplanation:\nJessica's income is $2,000 per month, which means she has a monthly income of $2,000 x 12 = $24,000 per year. If she spends 25% of her income on shoes, that's $24,000 x 0.25 = $6,000 per year.\nSince Jessica buys shoes irregularly, we can assume that the number of pairs she buys in a year is not fixed. However, based on the information provided, we can estimate the average number of pairs she buys per year.\nAssuming Jessica buys shoes every month, she would buy 12 pairs of shoes per year (12 months x $1,000 per pair).\nAssuming Jessica buys shoes irregularly, but on average buys 1 pair every 2 months, she would buy 6 pairs of shoes per year (6 months x $1,000 per pair).\nTherefore, the answer is between 6 and 12 pairs of shoes per year, with a probability of ###0.75### that the answer is correct.")

(990, ' Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue\nProbability: ###0.75###\n\nExplanation:\nThe air conditioner cooled the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. When the air conditioner was turned off, the room began to warm up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour again.\nTo find the final temperature after the air conditioner was turned off, we can use the formula:\nFinal temperature = Starting temperature + (Time x Rate of change)\nIn this case, the starting temperature was 2 degrees lower than the final temperature, and the air conditioner ran for a total of 7 hours (3 hours on low and 4 hours on high).\nSo, the final temperature after the air conditioner was turned off can be calculated as follows:\nFinal temperature = Starting temperature + (Time x Rate of change)\n= 2 - (7 x 2)\n= 2 - 14\n= 12\nTherefore, the final temperature after the air conditioner was turned off was 12 degrees higher than the starting temperature.\nThe probability that the answer is correct is ###0.75###, or 75%. This is because the calculation is based on the information provided in the problem, and the answer is reasonable given the rates of cooling and warming provided. However, there is some uncertainty in the problem, so the probability is not exactly 1.')
