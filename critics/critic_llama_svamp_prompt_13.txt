Let's assume that the number of toy cars in each box is independent and identically distributed (iid). This means that the number of toy cars in each box is equally likely to be any number between 0 and the capacity of the box.\nFrom the problem statement, we know that the capacity of the first toy box is 21, the capacity of the second toy box is 31, and the capacity of the third toy box is 19. So, the probability of any particular number of toy cars being in each box is:\n* First toy box: 21 possibilities (0, 1, 2, ..., 21)\n* Second toy box: 31 possibilities (0, 1, 2, ..., 31)\n* Third toy box: 19 possibilities (0, 1, 2, ..., 19)\nSince the number of toy cars in each box is iid, the probability of Joshua having a total of 71 toy cars (the sum of the number of toy cars in each box) is:\n* Probability of having 71 toy cars: 21 x 31 x 19 = 0.00000000071\nSo, the probability of Joshua having 71 toy cars is approximately ###0.00000000071###.")

Since 2 members did not show up, the total score is 18.0 + (5.0 x 6.0) = 48.0.\nTherefore, the answer is True, with a probability of ###0.8###, meaning that there is an 80% chance that the answer is correct.')

(4672, ' Based on the information provided, the answer is True.\n###prob### 1 - True\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n* The number of pencils is a positive integer (154).\n* The number of groups is a positive integer (11).\n* The number of pencils in each group is a non-negative integer (11).\nGiven these constraints, it is possible to divide the pencils into groups of 11 pencils each. Therefore, the answer is True.\nThe probability of the answer being correct is:\n###prob### 1 - True = 1 - (Number of incorrect answers) / (Total number of possible answers) = 1 - (16 / 154) = 0.9363 or approximately 93.63%.')

(4675, " Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue, but with a probability of ###0.95###.\nHere's why:\nThe problem states that there are 407 bananas in Philip's banana collection, and we need to divide them into 11 groups. Each group contains 36 bananas, so the total number of bananas in each group is 36 x 11 = 402 bananas.\nNow, the problem asks us to find the average number of bananas in each group. To do this, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups: 407 / 11 = 36.63 bananas per group.\nHowever, there is a small probability that the actual number of bananas in each group is not exactly 36. Therefore, the probability of the answer being correct is ###0.95###, or 95%.")

(4678, ' True, with a probability of ###0.8###.\nThe reasoning is as follows:\nRonald has a total of 16 eggs and 3 candies, which means he has a total of 20 things to share among 8 friends. Dividing the total number of things by the number of friends gives us the number of things each friend will get: 20 / 8 = 2.5 things per friend.\nSince Ronald has 16 eggs, each friend will get 2 eggs, which is the correct answer. Additionally, since Ronald has 3 candies, each friend will get 1 candy, which is also the correct answer.\nTherefore, the probability of the answer being correct is ###0.8###, or 80%.')
