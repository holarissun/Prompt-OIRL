(986, " True, with a probability of ###0.95###.\nHere's how I arrived at this answer:\nTo calculate the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to multiply the number of petunias and sweet potato vines for each basket, and then multiply that by the cost of each plant.\nFor the petunias, Katherine wants to add 3 plants per basket, so the total cost of petunias is:\n3 x 5 baskets = 15 petunias\n15 petunias x $3.00 per plant = $45.00\nFor the sweet potato vines, Katherine wants to add 2 plants per basket, so the total cost of sweet potato vines is:\n2 x 5 baskets = 10 sweet potato vines\n10 sweet potato vines x $2.50 per plant = $25.00\nTherefore, the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets is:\n$45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00\nSo, the answer is True, with a probability of ###0.95###, indicating that the answer is likely to be correct with a probability of 95%.")

(990, ' Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue, probability of correct answer: ###0.75###\nExplanation:\nThe problem states that the air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The problem also states that the room will warm up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner running.\nUsing the information provided, we can calculate the temperature change over time as follows:\nLow setting:\nAfter 3 hours on low, the temperature will be 3 degrees lower than the starting temperature, so the final temperature is:\nFinal temperature after 3 hours on low = Starting temperature - (3 x 2 degrees per hour) = Starting temperature - 6 degrees\nHigh setting:\nAfter 4 hours on high, the temperature will be 12 degrees lower than the starting temperature, so the final temperature is:\nFinal temperature after 4 hours on high = Starting temperature - (12 degrees per hour x 4 hours) = Starting temperature - 48 degrees\nTotal temperature change:\nAfter the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the temperature will start to warm up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner running. So, the final temperature after 2 hours is:\nFinal temperature after 2 hours = Starting temperature + (2 degrees per hour x 2 hours) = Starting temperature + 4 degrees\nNow, we need to find the total temperature change by adding the temperature changes from the low and high settings:\nTotal temperature change = Final temperature after 3 hours on low - Starting temperature + Final temperature after 4 hours on high - Starting temperature + 4 degrees\n= -6 degrees + 48 degrees + 4 degrees - Starting temperature\n= -44 degrees\n\nSo, the final temperature after 5 hours is approximately -44 degrees.\n\nProbability of correct answer:\nThe probability of the answer being correct is ###0.75###, which means that there is a 75% chance that the final temperature after 5 hours is approximately -44 degrees.')
