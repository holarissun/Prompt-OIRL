So, if Peter buys both, he will have spent $7 + $7 = $14.\nNow, we know that Peter has $42 for the week, and he has spent $14 on movie tickets and popcorn. That means he has $42 - $14 = $28 left for other expenses.\nStep 2: Find out how many times Peter can go to the movies with the money he has left.\nWe know that the cost of a movie ticket is $7, so if Peter wants to go to the movies multiple times, he will need to divide the money he has left by the cost of a ticket.\n$28 ÷ $7 = 4 times\nSo, Peter can go to the movies 4 times with the money he has left.\nTherefore, the answer is True, and the probability that the answer is correct is ###prob### 1.")

To determine how many batches she needs to make, we divide the number of days by the number of cookies per batch:\n60 cookies per month / 12 cookies per batch = 5 batches per month\nSince Shannon wants to store the cookies in the freezer, we need to determine how many cookies will fit in the freezer. Let's assume that each cookie takes up about the same amount of space in the freezer as they do in the cookie jar.\nAssuming an average size of 3 inches in diameter for a madeleine cookie, we can estimate that each cookie will take up about 3 square inches of space in the freezer.\nTo calculate the number of cookies that will fit in the freezer, we can divide the total volume of the freezer by the volume of each cookie:\nTotal volume of freezer = ?\nVolume of each cookie = 3 square inches\n? = 720 cookies (from the problem statement)\nSo, the answer is True, with a probability of ###0.95###.")

(989, ' Based on the information provided, I believe the answer is correct. 🤔\nTrue ###0.8\nThe calculation for the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp is correct, and the result is consistent with the information provided in the problem. Additionally, the calculation for the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp is also correct, and the result is consistent with the information provided in the problem. 📈\nTherefore, I would rate the probability of the answer being correct as follows:\nProbability of answer being correct: ###0.8###\nThis means that there is an 80% chance that the answer is correct.')

(990, " Based on the information provided, I believe the answer is False.\n###prob### 0.33\nHere's my reasoning:\nThe air conditioner cooled the room by 6 degrees during its 3 hours of operation on low mode, as per Clue #1. However, the question asks about the final temperature after the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room would have warmed up by 2 degrees (as per Clue #2), for a total temperature increase of 8 degrees (6 + 2).\nTherefore, the final temperature after the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours would be 8 degrees higher than the initial temperature, which is False.\nSo, the probability of the answer being correct is ###prob### 0.33.")

(991, " Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue\nProbability: ###0.9###\n\nExplanation:\nWe know that Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, and Bill is three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that Bill was 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.\nSo, the answer is True, and the probability of the answer being correct is ###0.9###, or approximately 90%.")

(993, ' Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue\nProbability of answer being correct: ###0.75###\n\nExplanation:\nThe first plane makes a total of x flights per day, and we know that it goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. So, the number of flights to France and Germany combined is equal to the number of flights to Greece minus three-quarters of the total number of flights.\nWe can write this as:\nx - 3/4x = 1/2\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nx = 3/4\nSo, the first plane makes 3/4 of its flights to Greece, and the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.\nThe other plane flies exclusively to Poland, so it makes 44 trips per day.\nTherefore, the answer is True, and the probability of the answer being correct is ###0.75###.')

(996, " True, with a probability of ###0.8###.\nThe reasoning is as follows:\nWe know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so the average age of the group is 1/2 \\* Helene's age. Since Helene's age is 28 years, the average age of the group is 28 / 2 = 14 years.\nWe also know that the total age of the children is 20 years, so the age of Wilfred is the least among the four children, which is 3 years.\nTherefore, the answer is True, with a probability of ###0.8###, meaning that there is an 80% chance that the answer is correct.")
