To do this, he can use all 154 pencils to form 14 groups of 11 pencils each, or he can use some of the pencils to form fewer groups.\nSince 154 is a relatively small number, it is highly likely that Peter will be able to form 14 groups of 11 pencils each, with a probability of ###0.95###.")

(4674, " Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue\nProbability: ###0.95###\n\nExplanation:\nWe know that Bridget has 820 blocks in her block collection, and she wants to organize them into groups. Let's assume that she wants to divide them into 82 groups, as you mentioned.\nTo calculate the number of blocks in each group, we can divide the total number of blocks by the number of groups:\n820 blocks / 82 groups = approximately 10 blocks per group (rounded to the nearest whole number)\nSo, the answer is True, and the probability that the answer is correct is ###0.95###, or approximately 95%.")

(4675, " True, with a probability of ###0.95###.\nThe reasoning is as follows:\nPhilip has 407 bananas in his collection, and he wants to organize them into 11 groups. To determine the number of bananas in each group, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups: 407 รท 11 = 36.\nSo, each group contains 36 bananas, which is a reasonable and practical number for organizing bananas.

====================
(4676, ' True, with a probability of ###0.95###.\nTo calculate the probability, we can use the following reasoning:\n* The number of boxes is known to be 53.\n* The total number of pencils is known to be 4028.\n* Therefore, the number of pencils in each box is 4028 / 53 = 76.\nSo, the probability that the answer is correct is approximately 0.95, or 95%.')

(4677, ' True, with a probability of ###0.8###.\nThe reasoning is as follows:\nPeter has 54 tickets and 4 pencils, which means he has a total of 54 + 4 = 58 items.\nIf he shares these items among 9 friends, each friend will receive a portion of the total items. In this case, 58 items divided by 9 friends is 6.67 items per friend (round down to 6 items per friend).\nSo, the answer is 6 tickets per friend, which is the correct solution.\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!')

(4678, ' True, with a probability of ###0.8###.\nThe reasoning is as follows:\nRonald has a total of 16 eggs and 3 candies.\nIf he wants to share the eggs among 8 friends, he will have to divide the total number of eggs by the number of friends he wants to share them with. In this case, he wants to share 16 eggs among 8 friends, so he will divide 16 by 8:\n16 รท 8 = 2\nSo, each friend will get 2 eggs from Ronald.\nTherefore, the answer is True, with a probability of ###0.8###, meaning that there is an 80% chance that the answer is correct.')

(4680, ' True, with a probability of ###0.75###.\nThe reasoning is as follows:\nLaura has 28 blocks to share among 4 friends, so the total number of blocks to be shared is 28. Since there are 4 friends, each friend will get a share of the blocks, which means that the number of blocks each friend gets is 28 / 4 = 7 blocks.\nSo, the answer is indeed 7 blocks per friend, which means the probability of the answer being correct is ###0.75###.')
