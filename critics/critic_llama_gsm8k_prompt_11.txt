So, we can set up the equation:\nDora's father's age = 2Dora's age + 8\nNow, we are told that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can find Dora's mother's age by subtracting four years from Dora's father's age:\nDora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4\nNow that we have Dora's age and the ages of her parents, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:\nTotal combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age\nSubstituting the values we have found, we get:\nTotal combined age = 15 + (2(15) + 4)\nTotal combined age = 39\nSo, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 39 years, with a probability of ###0.8### that the answer is correct.")

(971, " True, with a probability of ###0.95###.\nHere's how I arrived at this answer:\nThe problem states that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing he builds. So, for a fence that is 15 feet long, he will need 2 x 15 = 30 wood slats.\nHowever, the problem also states that the fence is rectangular, which means that the width is also a factor in determining the number of wood slats needed. In this case, the width of the fence is 10 feet, so we need to multiply the number of feet by the width to get the total area of the fence:\n15 feet x 10 feet = 150 square feet\nSince Robert needs 2 wood slats per foot of fencing, and the total area of the fence is 150 square feet, he will need:\n150 square feet / 2 wood slats per foot = 75 wood slats\nTherefore, the answer is True, with a probability of ###0.95###.")
