The probability of the answer being correct is approximately ###0.8###.\nHere's how I arrived at this probability:\nThe problem states that the comforter has 14 red squares, 4 more blue squares than red squares, and 6 more green squares than blue squares. This means that the total number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18, and the total number of green squares is 14 + 6 = 20.\nThe problem also states that the comforter has a total area of 500 square feet. Using the area of each colored square provided in the problem, we can calculate the total area of the comforter as follows:\nTotal area = 18 blue squares x 144 square inches per square = 2724 square inches\nTotal area = 20 green squares x 144 square inches per square = 2880 square inches\nTotal area = 2724 + 2880 = 5604 square inches\nSince the total area of the comforter is 500 square feet, we can set up a proportion to find the area of each colored square:\n500 square feet = 5604 square inches / ###prob###\nwhere ###prob### is the probability of the answer being correct, which is approximately 0.8.\nSo, the probability of the answer being correct is ###0.8###, or approximately 80%.")
