So, the number of boys can be calculated by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students:\nNumber of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls\nNumber of boys = 180 - (24 x Number of girls)\nNow, we are given that the number of girls is 180 - (24 x Number of boys). So, we can substitute this value in the equation for the number of boys:\nNumber of boys = 180 - (24 x Number of boys)\nNow, we have a equation with two variables (Number of boys and Number of girls) and two equations (the first equation is the total number of students in year 8, and the second equation is the number of girls). We can solve this system of equations to find the number of boys:\nNumber of boys = 180 - (24 x Number of boys)\nNumber of girls = 180 - (24 x Number of boys)\nNow, we can solve for Number of boys:\nNumber of boys = 180 - (24 x Number of boys)\nNumber of boys = 180 - 24x\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of Number of boys in the equation for Number of girls:\nNumber of girls = 180 - (24 x Number of boys)\nNumber of girls = 180 - 24x\nNow, we can solve for Number of girls:\nNumber of girls = 180 - 24x\n\nNow, we have the values of Number of boys and Number of girls:\nNumber of boys = 120\nNumber of girls = 60\nSo, the answer is:\nNumber of boys = 120\nNumber of girls = 60\n\nProb')

So, the number of bad carrots Faye's mom picked is:\n5 - 12 = -7\nTo find the total number of bad carrots, we add the number of bad carrots picked by Faye and Faye's mom:\n11 (from Faye) + (-7 from Faye's mom) = 4\nTherefore, the answer is True, and the probability of the answer being correct is ###0.8###.")

(1683, ' Based on the information provided, the answer is True.\n###prob### 1.0\n\nThe puzzle is straightforward, and the calculation is simple. Sara picked 35.0 pears from the orchard, and then she gave 28.0 pears to Dan. Therefore, Sara has 35.0 + 28.0 = 63.0 pears in total.\nSo, the answer is True, and the probability of the answer being correct is ###prob### 1.0.')

====================
(1684, ' True, with a probability of ###0.9###.\nThe reasoning is as follows:\nThe number of buses is given as 8, and the number of students per bus is given as 45. Therefore, the total number of students who went to the concert is:\n8 buses × 45 students per bus = 360 students\nSo, the answer is indeed correct, and the probability of it being correct is high, at ###0.9###.')
