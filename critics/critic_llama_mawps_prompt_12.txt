To find out how long it will take him to install the rest, we can divide the number of windows left to install by the time it takes to install each window: 3.0 windows / 6.0 hours per window = 0.5 hours per window.\nHowever, as Expert Problem Solver 2 pointed out, the builder may not work continuously, and may take breaks, have lunch, or work on other tasks. To account for this, we can use the concept of time efficiency to estimate the time it takes the builder to work on each window. Assuming the builder works on each window for 4.0 hours, on average, including breaks, we can multiply the number of windows left to install by the time it takes him to work on each window: 3.0 windows x 4.0 hours per window = 12.0 hours.\nSo, the answer is True, and the probability of the answer being correct is ###0.75###, or 75%.')

In this case, that's 80 puppies / 3 puppies per day = 26.67 days.\nHowever, as Expert 4 pointed out, the actual adoption time for puppies in shelters is around 21 days on average. So, we can use this as a baseline and adjust the answer accordingly.\nUsing a weighted average, we can give more importance to the more adoptable puppies.

This means that the amount of grain remaining onboard is 918.0 tons.\nTo calculate the probability of the answer being correct, we need to consider the likelihood of the ship originally containing 50,000 tons of grain, and the probability of 49,952.0 tons of grain spilling into the water.\nGiven that the ship is a typical cargo ship, it is likely that it was designed to carry a certain amount of grain, say 50,000 tons, as its maximum capacity. Therefore, the probability of the ship originally containing 50,000 tons of grain is relatively high, say 0.8.\nThe probability of 49,952.0 tons of grain spilling into the water can be calculated using the formula: P(X) = (number of grain spilled) / (total amount of grain on board). In this case, the probability of grain spilling into the water is 0.95, or ###0.95###.\nTo calculate the probability of the answer being correct, we multiply the probability of the ship originally containing 50,000 tons of grain by the probability of 49,952.0 tons of grain spilling into the water: ###0.8 x 0.95 = 0.77###.\nTherefore, the probability of the answer being correct is approximately 0.77, or ###0.77###.')
