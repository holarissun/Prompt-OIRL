Therefore, the total number of colors Beatrice bought is:\n6 x p + 4 x q = 112\nSince the total number of colors is equal to the number of packets Beatrice bought, we can set up the following equation:\n6p + 4q = 10\nSolving for p and q, we get:\np = 0.64 and q = 0.36\nSo, Beatrice bought approximately 64% of the colors (64/100 = 0.64) and the remaining 36% (36/100 = 0.36) were 16-piece packets.\nTherefore, the answer is True, with a probability of ###0.95###.")
