To convert the distance to meters, we multiply it by 1000 (since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer):\n715.0 kilometers × 1000 meters/kilometer = 715,000 meters\n4. To convert the time to seconds, we multiply it by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour):\n11.0 hours × 3600 seconds/hour = 3600 seconds\n5. Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled in seconds by multiplying the distance in meters by the time in seconds:\nTotal distance traveled = 715,000 meters × 3600 seconds = 259,750,000 seconds\n6. Finally, we can calculate the average speed in meters per second by dividing the total distance traveled by the time taken:\nAverage speed = Total distance traveled / Time taken\nAverage speed = 259,750,000 seconds / 11.0 hours = 23,245 meters per second\n7. To convert the average speed to kilometers per hour, we multiply it by 3.6 (since there are 3.6 kilometers in a mile):\nAverage speed in kilometers per hour = Average speed in meters per second × 3.6\nAverage speed in kilometers per hour = 23,245 meters per second × 3.6 = 82.3 kilometers per hour\n\nTherefore, the answer is ###True### with a probability")

The cost of these items is not given directly in the problem, but we can use some basic math to estimate the cost.\na. A baseball glove typically costs around $20.00 - $30.00. Let's assume the cost of Benny's baseball glove is $25.00.\nb. A baseball typically costs around $0.50 - $1.00. Let's assume the cost of Benny's baseball is $0.75.\nc. A bat typically costs around $20.00 - $30.00. Let's assume the cost of Benny's bat is $25.00.\n3. So, the total cost of Benny's baseball gear is: $25.00 (baseball glove) + $0.75 (baseball) + $25.00 (bat) = $50.75.\n4.
