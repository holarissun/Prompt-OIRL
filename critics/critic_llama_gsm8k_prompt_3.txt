However, there are some assumptions made in the calculation that may not be accurate, which could affect the accuracy of the answer.\nFirstly, the estimate of 2400 calories per day as the resting metabolic rate (RMR) for an average adult male may not be accurate for Andy's specific body composition and activity level. While the study you mentioned provides a general estimate, there are many factors that can influence an individual's RMR, such as age, sex, body composition, and physical activity level. Therefore, it's possible that Andy's RMR is higher or lower than the estimated value.\nSecondly, the calculation assumes that Andy will maintain a consistent calorie deficit throughout the 125 days until his birthday. However, it's likely that Andy's calorie deficit will vary from day to day, depending on his food choices, physical activity level, and other factors. This could affect the accuracy of the calculation.\nOverall, while the calculation is correct, there are some limitations to the accuracy of the answer due to the assumptions made.
