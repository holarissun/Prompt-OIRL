To do this, we need to add the number of points scored by the members who showed up to the number of points scored by the members who didn\'t show up.\nLet\'s call the number of points scored by the members who didn\'t show up "y". So, the total number of points scored by the entire team is:\n3x + y\nWe know that the total number of points scored by the team is 30, so we can set up the equation:\n3x + y = 30\nNow we need to solve for x and y. To do this, we can use the fact that the number of members who showed up is equal to the total number of members minus the number of members who didn\'t show up. So, we can write:\nx = 15 - 6 = 9\nAnd we know that the number of points scored by the members who didn\'t show up is equal to the total number of points scored minus the number of points scored by the members who showed up. So, we can write:\ny = 30 - 3x = 30 - 9 = 21\nNow we have found the values of x and y, so we can substitute them into the equation we set up earlier to find the total number of points scored by the team:\n3x + y = 30\nSubstituting x = 9 and y = 21, we get:\n3(9) + 21 = 30\nWhich simplifies to:\n')

To find out how many points Paul's cousin has, we can use the equation: Total points = Paul's points + Cousin's points.\nWe know Paul's points are 3103.0, so we can substitute that value into the equation: Total points = 3103.0 + Cousin's points.\nSince we are looking for the probability of the answer being correct, we need to estimate the probability of Paul's cousin having a certain number of points. We can do this by assuming that the cousin's points are randomly distributed between 0 and 5816 (since the total points are 5816).\nUsing a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 5816 / 2 (since the total points are 5816), we can estimate the probability of the cousin having a certain number of points.\nFor example, to find the probability of the cousin having 3103 points, we can use the normal distribution formula: Probability = (x - mean)^2 / (standard deviation^2)\nwhere x is 3103, and the mean and standard deviation are 0 and 5816 / 2, respectively.\nPlugging in these values, we get:\nProbability = (3103 - 0)^2 / (5816 / 2^2) = ###0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000")
