Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n37 = 15 + (37 - x)\nSubtracting 15 from both sides gives us:\n22 = (37 - x)\nDividing both sides by 2 gives us:\nx = 13.5\nSo, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 13.5 pounds.\nThe probability that the answer is correct is ###0.75###, or 75%.
