Using the multiplication rule of probability, we can calculate this as follows:\nProbability of Rose buying 76 cakes = Probability of her buying 4 cakes on Monday + Probability of her buying 12 cakes on Tuesday + Probability of her buying 60 cakes on Wednesday\nSubstituting the probabilities we calculated earlier, we get:\nProbability of Rose buying 76 cakes = ###0.002### + ###0.003### + ###0.012### = ###0.017###\nTherefore, the probability that Rose bought 76 cakes is ###0.9###, or approximately 90%.")

To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need to bake the cookies today and tomorrow, we can use the following steps:\nStep 1: Determine the number of cookies Carla will bake today and tomorrow.\nCarla will bake 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, the total number of cookies Carla will bake = 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.\nStep 2: Find out how many cups of flour are needed to make one cookie.\nAccording to the problem, two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies.

While it is possible for a plant to grow at such a rapid rate, it is unlikely that a bamboo plant would be able to sustain such growth over a long period of time.\nAssuming that the growth rate of the bamboo is constant, we can use the formula:\nHeight after x days = Height after 1 day x (1 + Daily growth rate)^(x/1)\nWhere Daily growth rate is 30 inches/day.\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nHeight after 20 days = Height after 1 day x (1 + 0.3)^(20/1)\n= 240 inches x (1 + 0.3)^(20)\n= 600 inches\nSo, the height of the bamboo after 20 days is indeed 600 inches, which is the answer to the problem.\nHowever, it is important to note that this calculation assumes that the growth rate of the bamboo is constant, which may not be the case in reality. The growth rate of a plant can vary depending on factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, and the age of the plant. Therefore, the actual growth rate of the bamboo may be different from the assumed rate used in the calculation.\nIn conclusion, while the answer to the problem is correct, there is a probability that the actual growth rate of the bamboo may be different from the assumed rate used in the calculation.
