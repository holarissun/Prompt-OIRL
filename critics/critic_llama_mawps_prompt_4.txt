To find the total number of pears picked, we need to add the number of pears picked by Keith and Jason.\nKeith picked 3.0 pears, so the total number of pears picked by him is 3.0.\nJason picked 2.0 pears, so the total number of pears picked by him is 2.0.\nIn total, Keith and Jason picked 3.0 + 2.0 = 5.0 pears.\nNow, let's consider Joan's pick of 5.0 apples. Since apples and pears are different fruits, we can't directly add Joan's apples to the total number of pears picked.
