To account for this, we can estimate the probability of this happening by assuming that the amount left as a tip is randomly distributed between $0.00 and $3.00.\nUsing a normal distribution with a mean of $3.00 and a standard deviation of $1.50 (which is a reasonable estimate for the range of tip amounts), we can calculate the probability of a customer leaving a tip between $0.00 and $3.00 as follows:\nProbability = (area between $0.00 and $3.00) / (total area of the normal distribution)\n= (0.00 + 3.00) / (3.00 x 2.50)\n= 0.25\n\nSo, the probability that the waiter earned exactly $15.00 from tips is ###0.25###, or approximately 25%.

To find out how many marbles Connie had to start with, we can use the equation: Total marbles = Number of marbles Connie had - Number of marbles given to Juan.\nWe know that the total number of marbles is 593.0, and the number of marbles given to Juan is 183.0. So, we can set up the equation:\nx + 183.0 = 593.0\nWhere x is the number of marbles Connie had to start with.\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 593.0 - 183.0\nx = 410.0\nSo, Connie had 410.0 marbles to start with.\nThe probability of the answer being correct is ###0.8###, or 80%.
