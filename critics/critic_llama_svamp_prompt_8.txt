However, 47 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, which means 47 / 103 = 0.45 (or 45%) of the total flowers were lost.\nTo calculate the number of bouquets Wendy could still make, we need to subtract the number of flowers that wilted from the total number of flowers available:\n103 - 47 = 56\nSo, Wendy could still make 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers.\nTherefore, the answer is True, with a probability of ###0.75###.")
