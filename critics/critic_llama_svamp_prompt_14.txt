(4680, ' True, with a probability of ###0.75###.\nThe reasoning is as follows:\nLaura has a total of 28 blocks to share among 4 friends. Dividing the total number of blocks by the number of friends gives us the number of blocks each friend will receive: 28 / 4 = 7 blocks per friend.\nSo, the answer is indeed 7 blocks per friend, with a probability of ###0.75###.')

====================
(4681, ' True, with a probability of ###0.8###.\nThe reasoning is as follows:\nCatherine has 18 bottle caps and 19 blocks, which means she has a total of 18 + 19 = 37 units of caps and blocks.\nIf she shares the bottle caps among 6 friends, each friend will receive a fraction of the total number of bottle caps, which is 37 / 6 = 6.17 bottle caps per friend.\nSo, the answer is True, and the probability of the answer being correct is ###0.8###, or 80%.')

====================
(4682, ' True, with a probability of ###0.7###.\nThe reasoning is as follows:\nDenise has 210 crayons initially, and she is sharing them among 30 friends. If she shares them equally, each friend will get 7 crayons (210 / 30 = 7).\nSo, the answer is correct with a probability of ###0.7###, or 70%.')

====================
(4683, ' Based on the information provided, the answer is True.\n###prob### 1\nThe calculation is correct, and the school will indeed need at least 11 buses to transport all 100 students and 20 teachers on the field trip, assuming each bus has 20 seats.')

====================
(4684, ' True, with a probability of ###0.99###.\nThe calculation is correct, and the answer is indeed 78 Skittles in each group.')

====================
(4685, ' True, with a probability of ###0.95###.\nThe calculation is correct, and the answer is indeed 4 bananas per group.')

====================
(4686, ' Based on the information provided, the answer is True.\n###prob### 1\nThe calculation is correct:\n316 bottle caps / 17 cookies = 18 bottle caps per cookie\n18 bottle caps per cookie x 18 boxes = 324 boxes\nSo, the answer is indeed 18 boxes.\nTherefore, the probability of the answer being correct is:\n###prob### 1\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.')

====================
(4687, ' Based on the calculation provided, the answer is:\nTrue\nProbability of answer being correct: ###0.95###\n\nExplanation:\nThe calculation for the number of cookies each friend will get is correct, and the total number of cookies and candy given away is also correct. Therefore, the answer is True, and the probability of the answer being correct is ###0.95###.')

====================
(4688, ' True, with a probability of ###0.9###.\nThe calculation is correct, and the answer is indeed 69 marbles per friend if Keith shares them equally among 79 friends.')

====================
(4689, ' True, with a probability of ###0.95###.\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n* The number of apples is 1720, and there are 43 students.\n* Each student gets 9 Skittles, so the total number of Skittles is 9 x 43 = 377.\n* Therefore, the total number of apples and Skittles is 1720 + 377 = 2097.\n* If the apples are divided equally among the students, each student will get 2097 / 43 = 48 apples and 377 Skittles.\nSo, the answer is True, and the probability of it being correct is ###0.95###.')
