To find the total volume of water poured, we multiply the volume of 1 bucket by the number of buckets: Total volume = Volume of 1 bucket x Number of buckets.\n4. Since we don't know the volume of 1 bucket, we can't directly solve for the total volume.\n5. However, we can use the fact that the total volume of water poured is equal to the volume of 1 bucket multiplied by the number of buckets. So, we can rewrite the equation as: Total volume = Volume of 1 bucket x Number of buckets.\n6. Now, we can use the given information to find the volume of 1 bucket: Volume of 1 bucket = Total volume / Number of buckets.\n7. Substituting the values we know into the equation, we get: Volume of 1 bucket = Total volume / 8.8.\n8.

To find out how many bug species she donated, we can use the information that she was left with 39 bug species after donating some of her collection.\nIf she originally had 98 bug species and donated some of them, then the number of bug species she donated must be equal to the number she had left minus the number she donated.\nLet's write this as an equation:\nNumber of bug species donated = Number of bug species left - Number of bug species donated\nNumber of bug species left = 39\nNumber of bug species donated = 98 - x\nWhere x is the number of bug species she donated.\nNow we need to solve for x.
