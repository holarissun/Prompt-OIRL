This means that the cost of each car wash could be anywhere between $12 and $18.\nUsing this distribution, we can calculate the probability that Tom pays exactly $720 in a year as follows:\nProbability = Number of ways Tom pays $720 in a year / Total number of possible outcomes\nUsing the normal distribution, there are approximately ###0.75### ways that Tom could pay $720 in a year.\nSo, the probability that the answer is correct is ###0.75###, or approximately 75%.")

We know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Using the information provided, we can calculate the average age of the group as follows:\nAverage age = (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4\n= (3 + 4 + 2 x (average age) + x) / 4\n= (3 + 4 + 2 x (3 + 4) / 4 + x) / 4\n= (3 + 4 + 8 / 4 + x) / 4\n= (11 / 4 + x) / 4\n= 2.75\nSo, the average age of the group is approximately 2.75 years.\nSince Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, her age is:\nHelene's age = 2 x average age\n= 2 x 2.75\n= 5.5 years\nNow, we need to find the age of Wilfred. Using the equation provided in the problem:\nWilfred's age = average age + Helene's age\n= 2.75 + 5.5\n= 8.25 years\nSo, the age of Wilfred is approximately 8.25 years.\nTherefore, the answer is True, and the probability of the answer being correct is ###0.8###, or approximately 80%.")
