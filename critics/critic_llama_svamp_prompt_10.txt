(415, " Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue\nProbability: ###0.8###\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem states that Carol and her mom planted 6 rows of potatoes, with 9 seeds in each row. This means they planted a total of 6 x 9 = 54 potatoes.\nHowever, the problem also states that the total area of the garden is 200 square feet. This means that the rows of potatoes are spaced out evenly across the garden, with each row taking up a fraction of the total area.\nAssuming that the rows are spaced evenly, we can estimate the number of potatoes per square foot of garden. Let's assume that each row takes up 1/6 of the total area, or 33.33% of the garden.\nUsing this ratio, we can calculate the number of potatoes per square foot of garden:\n54 potatoes / 200 square feet = 0.27 potatoes per square foot\nNow, let's multiply this number by the total area of the garden to find the total number of potatoes planted:\n0.27 potatoes per square foot x 200 square feet = 54 potatoes\nThis is the same number we calculated earlier, so it looks like the answer is correct!

So, the number of cups of flour Mary put in is equal to the number of cups she needs minus the number of cups she already put in.\nWe can assume that Mary put in at least some flour, since she wouldn't start baking a cake without any flour. Therefore, the probability that Mary put in 0 cups of flour is very low (###0.000001###).\nThe probability that Mary put in exactly 12 cups of flour is also low (###0.0001###), since she would have to put in exactly the right amount of flour to match the recipe's requirements.\nTherefore, the most likely scenario is that Mary put in somewhere between 1 and 12 cups of flour, with the probability of her putting in exactly 12 cups being the highest (###0.8###).")

This means that the remaining 918 tons of grain on the ship is a significant portion of the total amount of grain the ship was carrying.\nTo calculate the probability of the answer being correct, we need to consider the likelihood of the grain spilling evenly around the coral reef. Since the reef is a circle with a radius of 100 meters, the area of the circle is 7,850 square meters. If the grain spilled evenly around the reef, the amount of grain that spilled into each square meter of the reef is 49,952.0 tons/7,850 square meters = 6,374.3 tons per square meter.\nNow, let's calculate the probability of the answer being correct. Since the amount of grain spilled into the water is 49,082 tons, and the remaining 918 tons on the ship is a significant portion of the total amount of grain the ship was carrying (50,000 tons), we can estimate the probability of the answer being correct as follows:\nProbability = (Amount of grain spilled into water / Total amount of grain on ship) x (Amount of grain remaining on ship / Total amount of grain on ship)\nProbability = (49,082 / 50,000) x (918 / 50,000) = ###0.95###\nTherefore, the probability of the answer being correct is approximately ###0.95###, or 95%.")
