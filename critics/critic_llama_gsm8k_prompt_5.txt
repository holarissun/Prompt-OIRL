This means that the first plane takes 3/4 of the total number of flights to France.\nSo, the number of flights to France in one day is:\nTotal number of flights = 3/4 x Total number of flights in a day\nProbability of answer being correct: The probability of the answer being correct is 0.75, which means there is a 75% chance that the answer is correct.')

(994, " True, with a probability of ###0.9###.\nThe reasoning behind this is as follows:\nThe problem states that Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, and Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. This means that Igneous howls for 40 seconds (2 x 20 seconds).\nTherefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:\n60 seconds (Igneous) + 60 seconds (Tobias) + 60 seconds (Chikote) = 180 seconds\nDividing this total by 60 gives us the probability of the answer being correct:\n180 seconds / 60 = 3 minutes\nSo, with a probability of ###0.9###, the answer is correct.")

(995, " Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue\nProbability: ###0.8###\n\nExplanation:\nAdam's mother gave him $6 for the trousers, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $12. This means that Adam's mother contributed $6 and his father contributed $12, for a total of $18. Since the problem states that Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings, it is likely that the answer is correct. However, there is a small probability that Adam's mother or father contributed more than $6 or less than $12, respectively, which would result in a different amount that Adam had to contribute from his savings.")

(996, ' Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue\nProbability of correct answer: ###0.8###\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem states that the total age of the group of children is 20, and Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Therefore, the average age of the group is 20/2 = 10 years old.\nSince Wilfred is 3 years old, we can find his age by adding it to the average age of the group: 10 + 3 = 13 years old.\nTherefore, the answer is True, and the probability of the answer being correct is ###0.8###, or 80%.')

(998, ' Based on the information provided, the answer is:\nTrue\nProbability: ###0.75###\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem states that each guest brought 15 cookies to the wedding reception, and there were 100 guests in total. If the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door, then she gave 1/2 x 100 = 50 cookies to the church.\nThe problem also states that each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, so there are 50 / 15 = 3 people in the church next door.\nTherefore, the answer is True, and the probability that the answer is correct is ###0.75###.')

(999, " Based on the information provided, the answer is True.\n###prob### 1\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1. The family of 6 consists of 2 adults and 4 kids.\n2. Each adult wants a slice of watermelon that is twice as big as each kid's slice.\n3. Since there are 4 kids, each kid gets 1/4 of the watermelon, which is equal to 25% of the watermelon.\n4. Since there are 2 adults, each adult gets 2/4 of the watermelon, which is equal to 50% of the watermelon.\nTherefore, the total percentage of watermelon divided among the family of 6 is 50% for the adults and 25% for the kids, for a total of 75%.\nSo, the answer is True, and the probability that the answer is correct is ###prob### 1.")
