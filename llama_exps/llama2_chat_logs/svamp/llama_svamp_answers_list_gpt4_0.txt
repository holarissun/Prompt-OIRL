Convert the difference from cups to a simpler unit, such as teaspoons or tablespoons, to make the calculation easier:\n1 cup = 8 teaspoons\nSo, the difference in teaspoons is:\n3 cups = 3 x 8 teaspoons = 24 teaspoons\nC.

(1045, " Great, let's approach this problem logically! To find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add than cups of sugar, we can use the following steps:\n United States customary units (USC) cups are equal to 8 fluid ounces (fl oz). To convert cups to ounces, we can multiply by 8.\nSo, if Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar, which is equal to 10 x 8 = 80 ounces of sugar, we need to find out how many more ounces of flour she needs to add.\nThe recipe calls for 14 cups of flour, which is equal to 14 x 8 = 112 ounces of flour.\nTherefore, Mary needs to add 112 - 80 = 32 ounces of flour more than the 80 ounces of sugar she has already added.\nTo convert ounces to cups, we can divide by 8:\n32 ÷ 8 = 4 cups\nSo, Mary needs to add 4 more cups of flour than the 10 cups of sugar she has already added.")

If the problem states that he sold more than 78 books, then we would have overcounted the number of books Paul has left with him. If the problem states that he sold less than 78 books, then we would have undercounted the number of books Paul has left with him.\nIn this case, the problem states that Paul sold 78 books, so our answer of 37 books left with him is correct.\n\nAnd that's how we find the answer to the problem!")

In this case, we need to find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill.\n\nStep 3: Use the information given in the problem to find the answer. Let\'s use the first statement: "Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven."\nSo, if Jake has x peaches, then Steven has x + 5 peaches.\nNow, let\'s use the second statement: "Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill."\nSo, if Steven has y peaches, then Jill has y - 18 peaches.\nNow, we are given that Jill has 87 peaches.\nSo, we can set up the equation:\nJake has x peaches\nSteven has x + 5 peaches\nJill has y - 18 peaches\ny = 87\n\nStep 4: Solve the equation to find the answer. To solve the equation, we can first solve for y (the number of peaches Jill has):\ny = 87\ny = 49\n\nNow, we can find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill:\n\nJake has x peaches\nJill has 49 peaches\nSo,')

Let\'s call the total revenue generated from t-shirts "R1" and the total revenue generated from jerseys "R2".\nWe are also given that the Razorback Shop sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. So, we can calculate the total revenue generated from both products as follows:\nR1 = 254 x $86 = $21,764\nR2 = 43 x $232 = $9,752\nNow, to find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, we need to subtract the revenue generated from t-shirts from the revenue generated from jerseys.\n$9,752 - $21,764 = $11,992\nSo, a jersey costs $11,992 more than a t-shirt.\nTherefore, the answer to the question is $11,992.')

To find out how many boxes he needed, we can divide the number of games he has left by the number of games he can pack into each box:\n16.0 games / 8.0 games per box = 2 boxes\nSo, Edward had to use 2 boxes to pack his remaining games.")

We know that the pet store had 81.0 puppies and sold 41.0 of them, so the total number of puppies they had after selling some was 81.0 - 41.0 = 40.0 puppies.

To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we can use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Write the information given in the problem.\nNumber of girls trying out for the basketball team = 9.0\nNumber of boys trying out for the basketball team = 14.0\nNumber of students called back for the basketball team = 2.0\n\nStep 2: Use the information to set up an equation. In this case, we can use the total number of students trying out (9.0 + 14.0) to find the number of students who didn't make the cut:\nTotal number of students trying out = Number of students called back + Number of students who didn't make the cut\n9.0 + 14.0 = 2.0 + x\n\nStep 3: Solve the equation. To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, we can subtract the number of students called back from the total number of students trying out:\n2.0 + x = 9.0 + 14.0\nSubtracting 2.0 from both sides gives us:\nx = 7.0\n\nStep 4: Find the answer. In this case, 7.0 is the number of students who didn't make the cut.\nSo, 7 students didn't make the cut for the school's basketball team.")

We can do this by multiplying the number of packages Louis ate by the number of Lemon Heads in each package:\n9 packages × 0.67 Lemon Heads per package = 6.03 Lemon Heads\nSo, Louis has 6.03 Lemon Heads left.\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is:\nLouis ate 9 packages of Lemon Heads, and he has 6.03 Lemon Heads left.")

So, the total number of packs sold = 23 + 28 = 51 packs.\nStep 2: Since the end of the month is in 2 days, let's assume that the villagers sold all the cookies they had in stock during these 2 days.\nSo, the total number of cookies sold = 51 packs x number of cookies per pack = 51 x x, where x is the number of cookies in each pack.\nStep 3: Since we know that the villagers sold cookies to neighboring villages, we can assume that the number of cookies sold in each village is equal.\nSo, the number of cookies sold in each village = 51 x x / 2 = 25.5 x x, where x is the number of cookies in each pack.\nStep 4: To find out how many cookies were sold in total, we can multiply the number of cookies sold in each village by the number of villages they sold to.\nSo, the total number of cookies sold = 25.5 x x / 2 x number of villages = 25.5 x x, where x is the number of cookies in each pack.\nTherefore, the villagers were able to sell 25.5 x x cookies in total.\nStep 5: Finally, we can find out how many cookies were sold in each village by dividing the total number of cookies sold by the number of villages they sold to.\nSo, the number of cookies sold in each village = 25.5 x x / 2 = x, where x is the number of")

We repeat step 2 every day.\nSo, after 2 days, the worm will have slid back 6 inches (3 x 2 = 6), leaving it 11 inches from the top (5 + 6 = 11).\n4. We continue this pattern, with the worm sliding back 3 inches every day and climbing 8 inches every day.\nAfter 3 days, the worm will have slid back 9 inches (6 x 3 = 9), leaving it 11 inches from the top (11 - 9 = 2).\nAfter 4 days, the worm will have slid back 12 inches (9 x 4 = 12), leaving it 10 inches from the top (2 + 12 = 14).\nAnd so on.\nTo find the number of days it will take the worm to reach the top, we can simply keep track of the number of inches the worm slides back each day and add it to the distance it climbs each day.\nSo, after 1 day, the worm is 8 inches from the top. After 2 days, it is 11 inches from the top. After 3 days, it is 14 inches from the top, and so on.\nTherefore, it will take the worm [14 + 11 + 10 + ... +")

(4232, " Great! Let's approach this problem logically:\n\n1. Mike found 62 seashells on the beach.\n2. Mike gave some of his seashells to Tom.\n3.

To find out, we can use the information that Mike has 13 seashells left after giving some to Tom.\nSo, the number of seashells Mike gave to Tom is equal to the number of seashells he had left minus the number of seashells he gave to Tom. In this case, that would be:\n13 (seashells left) - x (seashells given to Tom) = 62 (total number of seashells found)\nWe are told that Mike found 62 seashells, and he gave some to Tom, so the number of seashells he gave to Tom must be less than 62. Let's call this number x.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n13 - x = 62\n\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 59\n\nSo, Mike gave Tom 59 seashells.")

If there are 9 friends, then the total number of chicken wings the chef cooked is 25 x 9 = 225 chicken wings.\nSince each person will get the same amount, we can divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of people to find out how many each person will get: 225 chicken wings ÷ 9 people = 25 chicken wings per person.\n\nStep 4: Check your answer:\nTo check your answer, you can multiply the number of chicken wings each person will get by the number of people in the group: 25 chicken wings per person x 9 people = 225 chicken wings total.\nThis is the same answer we got in step 3, so we know our answer is correct!\n\nAnd that's how you solve the problem!")
