A problem can involve a variety of mathematical concepts, including numbers, shapes, and patterns. In this case, we are given the following information:\n1. The waiter at "The Greasy Spoon" restaurant had 39 customers to wait on during the lunch rush.\n2. During the lunch rush, an additional 12 customers came in.\n3. If 49 of the customers did not leave a tip, then how many customers did leave a tip?\nTo solve this problem, we need to use basic arithmetic and reasoning skills. Here are the steps we can follow:\nStep 1: Find out the total number of customers the waiter had to wait on.\nTotal number of customers = 39\n\nStep 2: Find out the total number of customers who came in during the lunch rush, including the additional 12 customers.\nTotal number of customers during lunch rush = 39 + 12 = 51\n\nStep 3: Find out the percentage of customers who did not leave a tip.\nPercentage of customers who did not leave a tip = 49 / 51 = 96%\n\nStep 4: Use the percentage from step 3 to find out the number of customers who did leave a tip.\nNumber of customers who left a tip = 51 - 49 = 2\n\nTherefore, 2 customers out of the 51 customers the waiter had to wait on during the lunch rush left a tip.')

To find out how many roses she cut, we can look for the word "roses" in the problem. We see that the problem states "Jessica cut some more roses and orchids." So, Jessica cut some roses, but not orchids.\nStep 2: Find out how many roses Jessica cut.\nWe know that there were initially 15 roses in the vase, and Jessica cut some more roses. To find out how many roses she cut, we can subtract the initial number of roses from the total number of roses after she cut some more.\n15 roses (initial) + x roses (cut by Jessica) = 17 roses (total after cutting)\nWe are asked to find out how many roses Jessica cut, so we want to solve for "x".

We are told that Frank put some pieces of candy equally into 2 bags. If he put 8 pieces of candy into each bag, then that means he put a total of 8 + 8 = 16 pieces of candy into the 2 bags together. This is the same number of pieces of candy that Frank had originally, so our answer is correct!\nTherefore, if Frank had 16 pieces of candy and put them into 2 bags, each bag would contain 8 pieces of candy.")

Benny had $88.0 dollars over after buying the baseball gear, so we can set up the equation:\nx + y + z = 88.0\n4. We know that Benny spent a total of $32.0 dollars on the baseball gear, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\nx + y + z = 88.0\n5.

Europe: 4.0 continents x 122.0 books = 492.0 books\n4. North America: 4.0 continents x 122.0 books = 492.0 books\n\nStep 3: Add up the total number of books Bryan collected from all 4 continents\nWe have collected 492.0 books from Africa, 492.0 books from Asia, 492.0 books from Europe, and 492.0 books from North America. Therefore, the total number of books Bryan collected from all 4 continents is:\n492.0 + 492.0 + 492.0 + 492.0 = 1,966.0 books\n\nTherefore, Bryan has a total of 1,966.0 books from all 4 continents combined.")

Find out how many pictures are left to color:\nWe need to subtract the number of pictures Debby has already colored from the total number of pictures in the two coloring books.\nThe first coloring book had 16.0 pictures, and Debby has already colored 33.0 of them, so the number of pictures left to color is:\n16.0 - 33.0 = 17.0\nThe second coloring book had 40.0 pictures, and Debby has already colored 33.0 of them, so the number of pictures left to color is:\n40.0 - 33.0 = 7.0\n3. Check your calculations:\nTo make sure you have calculated correctly, you can double-check your work by counting the number of pictures Debby has colored and comparing it to the total number of pictures in each coloring book.\nSo, in the first coloring book, Debby has colored 33 out of 16 pictures (16 x 33 / 100 = 52), and in the second coloring book, she has colored 33 out of 40 pictures (40 x 33 / 100 = 132).\nTherefore, Debby still has 13 pictures left to color in the first coloring book and 47 pictures left to color in the second coloring book.')

Since she added some shells, we can represent the new amount of shells as x + y pounds, where y is the amount she added.\nSo, the problem is to find the value of y, the amount of shells Jovana added.\n\nStep 3: Use the information given in the problem to find y:\nWe are given that Jovana's new amount of shells is 28.0 pounds, so we can set up the equation:\nx + y = 28\n\nStep 4: Solve the equation:\nNow, we need to isolate the variable y, which represents the amount of shells Jovana added. We can do this by subtracting x from both sides of the equation:\ny = 28 - x\n\nStep 5: Check the solution:\nTo check our answer, let's plug in the value of x = 5.0 pounds, which is the amount of shells Jovana had initially. This gives us:\ny = 28 - 5 = 23 pounds\nSo, Jovana added 23 pounds of shells.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is 23 pounds.")

(3974, ' To determine the number of fleas that perished, we need to first identify the total number of fleas in Harry Hound\'s ears before cleaning them out.\nFrom the passage, we know that:\n* In Harry Hound\'s right ear, there were 36 frisky fleas having a party.\n* In Harry Hound\'s left ear, there were 85 baby fleas sleeping peacefully.\nSo, the total number of fleas in Harry Hound\'s ears before cleaning them out is:\n36 + 85 = 121 fleas\nNow, we need to determine how many fleas were cleaned out during the ear cleaning process. The passage doesn\'t provide this information directly, but we can make an educated estimate based on the description of the cleaning process.\nThe passage states that you "peered into his ears" and found the fleas. This suggests that you used a light source or a magnifying glass to examine Harry Hound\'s ears closely. It\'s unlikely that you would have been able to see every single flea in his ears, especially if there were a large number of them.\nAssuming that you were only able to see a representative sample of the fleas in Harry Hound\'s ears, we can estimate that you cleaned out a percentage of the total number of fleas. Let\'s use a conservative estimate of 50% for the percentage of fleas that you cleaned out.\nSo, the number of fleas that perished during the ear cleaning process is:\n121 fleas x 50% = 60.5 fleas\nTherefore, approximately 60.5 fleas perished during the ear cleaning process.')

To determine the total number of groups required, we need to calculate the number of groups that can be formed with 7 members and the number of groups that can be formed with 3 members.\nNumber of groups that can be formed with 7 members = 90 / 7 = 13\nNumber of groups that can be formed with 3 members = 90 / 3 = 30\nTherefore, the total number of groups required is 13 + 30 = 43 groups.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of large groups:\nSince we want to make the least number of groups, we want to form as few large groups as possible. The number of large groups that can be formed with 7 members is 13, as we determined in step 1. Therefore, the number of large groups that can be formed is 13.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of small groups:\nSince we have 30 members left after forming the large groups, we want to form as many small groups as possible. The number of small groups that can be formed with 3 members is 30 / 3 = 10 groups.\nTherefore, the total number of groups that can be formed is 13 (large groups) + 10 (small groups) = 23 groups.\n\nSo, to make the least number of groups, we should form 13 large groups and 10 small groups, for a total of 23 groups.")

(4173, ' To find out how many snails were originally in Centerville, we need to use the information given in the problem.\nLet\'s break it down step by step:\n1. The people of Centerville work together to get rid of 3482 snails. This means that the number of snails in Centerville before the people started working together is:\n3482 + original number of snails = ?\n2. After the people have worked together to get rid of 3482 snails, there are still 8278 snails left in Centerville. So, the number of snails in Centerville after the people have worked together is:\n8278 = ? - 3482\nNow we have two equations:\n1. 3482 + x = ?\n2. x - 3482 = 8278\nwhere x is the original number of snails in Centerville.\nTo solve for x, we can add equation 1 to equation 2:\n3482 + x = ?\nSubtracting 3482 from both sides gives us:\nx = ? - 3482\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. To solve for x, we can use substitution or elimination. Let\'s use substitution.\nSolving for x in the first equation, we get:\nx = 3482 + 8278 = 11760\nNow we can plug this value of x into the second equation:\n11760 - 3482 = 8278\nWhich gives us:\n-1482 = 8278\nThis is impossible, since a negative number cannot be equal to 8278. Therefore, the original number of snails in Centerville must have been at least 1482.\nSo, the answer to the question "How many snails were originally in Centerville?" is:\nAt least 1482 snails')

(4341, " Great, let's break down the problem into steps to solve it:\nPerfect! Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:\n1. Jerry has 30 ice cubes in his freezer.\n2. He needs to get ice for 6 cups.\nNow, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many pieces of ice Jerry should put in each cup to make them have the same amount.\nStep 1: Convert the number of ice cubes to grams\nSince ice is approximately 9% water by weight, we can use this conversion factor to convert the number of ice cubes to grams. Let's assume that each ice cube weighs approximately 0.09 kg (or 900 grams).\nSo, if Jerry has 30 ice cubes, that's:\n30 ice cubes x 0.09 kg/ice cube = 2.7 kg (or 2700 grams) of ice\nStep 2: Calculate the amount of ice needed for 6 cups\nNow, let's calculate how much ice Jerry needs for 6 cups. Since each cup requires approximately 28 grams of ice, Jerry needs:\n6 cups x 28 grams/cup = 168 grams of ice\nStep 3: Calculate the number of pieces of ice needed for 6 cups\nNow that we know how much ice Jerry needs, we can calculate how many pieces of ice he should put in each cup to make them have the same amount. Since each piece of ice weighs approximately 0.02 kg (or 200 grams), Jerry needs:\n168 grams / 0.02 kg/piece = 840 pieces of ice for 6 cups\nSo, to make 6 cups of ice have the same amount, Jerry should put 840 pieces of ice in each cup.")

One way to do this is to use each marble as a "divider" to separate the eggs into groups of 2.\n\nStep 6: Solve the problem\nTo create 4 groups of 2 eggs each, we can use the marbles as follows:\n\n* Use 1 marble to separate the 16 eggs into 2 groups of 8 eggs each.\n* Use the second marble to separate the remaining 8 eggs into 2 groups of 4 eggs each.\n\nSo, Rebecca can create 4 groups of 2 eggs each by using the 3 marbles as dividers.')

Since Chris has 1804 cookies and 10 pieces of candy, we can write:\nS = 1804 + 10 = 1814\nNow, we need to find out how many cookies each friend will get. To do this, we can divide the total number of sweets (S) by the number of friends (82):\nNumber of cookies each friend will get = S / 82\nNow we can plug in the values we have found:\nNumber of cookies each friend will get = 1814 / 82 = 22.5\nSo each friend will get approximately 22.5 cookies.\nLet\'s round this number up to the nearest whole number to make it easier to work with:\nEach friend will get 23 cookies.\nTherefore, Chris will have 82 friends and will give each of them 23 cookies, for a total of 1814 cookies.')
