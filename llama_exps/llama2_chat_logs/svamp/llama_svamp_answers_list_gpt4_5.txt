(102, " Great, let's solve this problem together!\nYou put a number into the machine and the machine added 15 and then subtracted 6, resulting in the number 35 coming out of the machine.\nTo find out what number you put in, we can use a process of elimination. Since the machine added 15 to the number you put in, the number that came out of the machine (35) is 15 more than the number you put in.\nSo, the number you put in was 20.\nHere's how we got to that answer:\n1. You put a number into the machine.\n2. The machine added 15 to the number you put in, so the number that came out of the machine is 15 more than the number you put in.\n3.

Let's map our route:\n\nFrom the starting point, the mailman can go in any of the 4 directions (up, down, left, or right).

(839, ' To determine the number of students who participated in suggesting new food items, we need to count the number of students who suggested each food item.\nFor mashed potatoes, 324 students suggested it.\nFor bacon, 374 students suggested it.\nFor tomatoes, 128 students suggested it.\nSo, a total of 324 + 374 + 128 = 826 students participated in suggesting new food items.')

====================
(840, " Great! Let's use a simple mathematical approach to solve this problem.\nWe know that 257 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, and 120 suggested adding bacon. We also know that 97 students suggested adding tomatoes.\nTo find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than suggested bacon, we can use the following formula:\nNumber of students who suggested mashed potatoes - Number of students who suggested bacon\nSo, in this case, the answer would be:\n120 (students who suggested bacon) - 257 (students who suggested mashed potatoes) = -137\nThis means that 137 more students suggested mashed potatoes than suggested bacon.\nI hope this helps!

(845, " Great, let's analyze the data!\nSo, out of the 269 students who suggested food options, 330 suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu. That means that 330 students preferred mashed potatoes over the other options.\nOut of the 269 students, 76 suggested adding tomatoes to the menu. So, the number of students who suggested tomatoes is 76.\nNow, to find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested tomatoes from the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes.\nSo, the difference between the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and those who suggested tomatoes is:\n330 - 76 = 254\nTherefore, there are 254 more students who suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon.")

So, if we want to find out how many more kids she played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of kids she played with on Tuesday from the number of kids she played with on Monday.\nLet's do that:\nMonday: 9 kids\nTuesday: 7 kids\nWednesday: 96 kids\nSo, the difference between the number of kids Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is:\n9 - 7 = 2\nTherefore, Julia played with 2 more kids on Monday than she did on Tuesday.")

We know that he picked 172 potatoes, so he must have picked some tomatoes as well. Let's assume he picked x tomatoes.\nWe can set up the following equation:\n175 - x = 172\nTo solve for x, we can subtract 172 from both sides of the equation:\n53 = x\nSo, the farmer has 53 tomatoes left.\nTherefore, the farmer has 175 - 53 = 122 tomatoes and -95 potatoes left in his garden.")

Let\'s start by using the information given in the problem:\n\nThe farmer had 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden.\nIf he picked 53 tomatoes, how many tomatoes and potatoes does he have left?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the concept of "subtraction" or "taking away."

First, we need to find the total number of yards of material in the original 24.0 yard length of cloth. We can do this by multiplying the length of cloth (in yards) by the number of pieces:\n24.0 yards x 3 pieces = 72.0 yards\n2. Next, we need to find the total number of yards of material in each of the 3 pieces that are 3.5 yards long.

Now, we need to find the total number of yards of material in each of the 5 pieces that are 2.25 yards long. We can do this by multiplying the length of each piece (in yards) by the number of pieces:\n2.25 yards x 5 pieces = 11.25 yards\n4. Finally, we need to subtract the total number of yards of material in each of the 3 pieces that are 3.5 yards long from the total number of yards of material in the original 24.0 yard length of cloth.

To find out how much hair this is, we can divide the length of hair she had by the length of each cut:\n0.375 inches / 0.375 inches per cut = 1 cut\nSo, Elizabeth had 1 cut of hair cut off on her first visit.\nOn her second visit, she asked for another 0.5 inches to be cut off. To find out how much hair this is, we can divide the length of hair she wanted to cut off by the length of each cut:\n0.5 inches / 0.375 inches per cut = 1.375 cuts\nSo, Elizabeth had 1.375 cuts of hair cut off on her second visit.\nNow, let's add up the number of cuts she had over both visits:\n1 + 1.375 = 2.375 cuts\nTherefore, Elizabeth had 2.375 inches of hair cut off in total. üíá\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è")

To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n21 √∑ 3 = Number of days\n\nNow we can see that it will take 7 days to adopt all the puppies in the shelter (21 √∑ 3 = 7).\nSo, in 7 days, all the puppies in the shelter will be adopted!\n\nGreat, let\'s summarize our route through the maze:\n\n1.

Divide the remaining apples by the number of apples needed for each pie (8.0): 56.0 √∑ 8.0 = 7.0\nSo, they could make 7 pies.\nGreat, let's summarize our route so far:\n* We started with the total number of apples (75.0)\n* We subtracted the number of apples given to students (19.0) to get the remaining apples (56.0)\n* We divided the remaining apples by the number of apples needed for each pie (8.0) to find out how many pies they could make: 7 pies.\nNow, let's continue navigating the maze to find the answer to the next question:\nWhat is the total cost of the pies if it costs $2.50 per pie?")

(3564, " Great, let's solve this problem together!\nFinn has 89 goldfish and 32 of them die. To find out how many goldfish are left, we need to subtract the number of goldfish that died from the initial number of goldfish.\n89 - 32 = 57\nSo, there are 57 goldfish left.\nNow, let's imagine we're navigating a maze to find the answer. Each decision brings us closer to the center of the maze, which represents the solution to the problem.\nWe start at the entrance of the maze, which represents the initial number of goldfish (89). As we navigate through the maze, we make decisions that lead us closer to the center. In this case, we make a decision to subtract the number of goldfish that died (32), which moves us further away from the entrance and closer to the center of the maze.\nAs we continue to navigate the maze, we make more decisions based on the information we've gathered, until we reach the center of the maze, which represents the final answer (57).\nSo, the path we take to find the answer is:\nEntrance of the maze (89) - Decision to subtract the number of goldfish that died (32) - More decisions based on the updated information (57)\nI hope this helps you visualize the problem and find the answer!

Second stopover: 368 miles from Katie's place (236 miles + 132 miles)\nNow, to find out how much farther the island is from the second stopover, we need to calculate the distance between the second stopover and the island.\nLet's assume the island is located at a distance X miles from the second stopover.\nSo, the total distance traveled by Katie from her place to the island is:\nDistance = X + 368 + 236 = 644 miles\nTherefore, the island is 644 miles away from the second stopover.")

Let's substitute equation (1) into equation (2):\nX + Y + Z = 23\nX + Y + Z = 7\nSubtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:\nX = 16\nNow we know that there are 16 pictures in the first album, 7 pictures in the second album, 11 pictures in the third album, 7 pictures in the fourth album, and 7 pictures in the fifth album.\nSo, the number of pictures in each album is:\n16, 7, 11, 7, 7\nI hope this helps you navigate the problem!

Megan can finish 8 spelling problems in an hour. This means she can finish 8/28 = 1/3 of the spelling problems in an hour.\n2. To find out how long it will take Megan to finish all the spelling problems, we can multiply the number of problems she can finish in an hour by the number of hours she has to finish them in:\n1/3 x 2 = 2/3 hours\nSo, it will take Megan 2/3 hours to finish all the spelling problems.\nNow that we have the time it will take Megan to finish each set of problems, we can combine them to find out how long it will take her to finish all the problems:\n1. Megan can finish 8 math problems in an hour, so it will take her 1/4 hours to finish all the math problems.\n2.
