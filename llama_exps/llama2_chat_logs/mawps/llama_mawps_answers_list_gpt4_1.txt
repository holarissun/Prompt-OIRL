Let's call it $X.\nOriginal price = $X\n\nStep 2: Find the new price of petroleum oil after the 10% increase.\nNew price = $X × (1 + 0.10)\n= $X × 1.10\n\nStep 3: Find the percentage change in the petroleum bill.\nPercentage change = (New price - Original price) / Original price\n= ($1.10 - $X) / $X\n= 0.10\n\nSo, the consumer's petroleum bill will change by 10% if he reduces his oil consumption by the same percent as the price increase.\nTherefore, if the original price of petroleum oil was $X, the consumer's petroleum bill will change by $0.10 for every $1.00 increase in the price of petroleum oil.")

If the waiter had 2 tables initially and -12.0 tables after the customers left, that means he had a total of 2 + (-12.0) = -10.0 tables after the customers left.\nSince the problem states that the waiter had 4.0 people at each table, the total number of people at the waiter's tables after the customers left is:\n-10.0 tables x 4.0 people/table = -40.0 people\nThis makes sense, as the problem states that 14.0 customers left, and -40.0 people is the number of customers that left.\n\nTherefore, the waiter had ")

Since each potato takes 9.0 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 1 x 9.0 = 9 minutes to cook the remaining potato.\nSo, the total time it will take the chef to cook all 15 potatoes is:\n72 minutes + 9 minutes = 81 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take the chef 81 minutes to cook all 15 potatoes.")

Since there are some girls, we can conclude that the number of girls on the playground is some girls.\n\nStep 4: Find the answer\nTo find the number of girls on the playground, we can use the information that there are some girls.

There are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon, and there are 0.125 miles per ounce (since there are 1,000 ounces in a mile). So, 5.0 gallons is equal to:\n5.0 gallons x 128 fluid ounces/gallon = 640 fluid ounces\n640 fluid ounces / 0.125 miles/ounce = 500 miles\nStep 3: Find the total distance you can drive\nNow that we know how many miles are in 5.0 gallons of gas, we can find out how far you can drive by multiplying the number of miles per gallon by the number of gallons you have:\n20.0 miles/gallon x 5.0 gallons = 100 miles\nSo, you can drive 100 miles on 5.0 gallons of gas.\nGreat, now you know how many miles you can drive on 5.0 gallons of gas!")

Let's assume the distance to California is x miles and the distance back is y miles.\nStep 3: Find the distance traveled on the way to California\nWe know the average speed on the way to California was 50.0 miles per hour, so the distance traveled can be calculated as:\ndistance = speed x time\nWe don't know the exact time it took to travel to California, but we do know the total time for the trip was 5 hours (since the return trip took 5 hours as well). So, the distance traveled on the way to California is:\ndistance = 50.0 miles/hour x 5 hours = 250 miles\nStep 4: Find the distance traveled on the way back\nSimilarly, we can find the distance traveled on the way back by using the average speed of 60.0 miles per hour and the total time of 5 hours:\ndistance = 60.0 miles/hour x 5 hours = 300 miles\nStep 5: Find the total distance traveled\nNow we have the distance traveled on the way to California (250 miles) and the distance traveled on the way back (300 miles).
