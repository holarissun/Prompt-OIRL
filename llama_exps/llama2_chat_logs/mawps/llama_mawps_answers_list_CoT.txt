Sample size: The administrator has sampled 12 PCs out of a total of 216 PCs connected to the LAN.\n2. Proportion of infected PCs in the sample: The administrator found that 7 out of 12 sampled PCs (or 58.3%) are infected.\n3. Estimating the proportion of infected PCs in the entire LAN: Since the sample size is only 12 out of 216 PCs, we can use the sample proportion formula to estimate the proportion of infected PCs in the entire LAN:\np = (number of infected PCs in the sample / total number of PCs in the sample) x 100\np = (7 / 12) x 100 = 58.3%\n4. Estimating the number of infected PCs in the entire LAN: Now, we can use the proportion of infected PCs in the entire LAN to estimate the number of infected PCs:\nnumber of infected PCs = total number of PCs in the LAN x estimated proportion of infected PCs\nnumber of infected PCs = 216 PCs x 58.3% = 124.6 PCs\nSo, based on the sample data provided, it is estimated that around 124.6 PCs out of 216 PCs connected to the LAN are infected with the new virus.")

(3006, " If the price of petroleum oil went up by 10.0%, and the consumer reduced his oil consumption by the same percentage, then the consumer's petroleum bill will be changed by a different percentage.\nTo find the percentage change in the consumer's petroleum bill, we need to use the following formula:\nChange in petroleum bill = (Original petroleum bill x Percentage change in price) / (1 - Percentage change in consumption)\nIn this case, the original petroleum bill is 100 (since the price of petroleum oil went up by 10.0%). The percentage change in price is also 10.0% (since the price went up by 10.0%).\nThe percentage change in consumption is also 10.0%, since the consumer reduced his oil consumption by the same percentage as the price increase.\nTherefore, the change in petroleum bill can be calculated as follows:\nChange in petroleum bill = (100 x 10.0%) / (1 - 10.0%) = 10%\nSo, the consumer's petroleum bill will be changed by 10%.")

We can do this by finding the value of x, which is the number of puppies in the shelter initially.\nSo, we can substitute the value of x = 3.0 into the equation y = (3x - 3)/3 to find the number of days it will take for all the puppies to be adopted:\ny = (3(3) - 3)/3\ny = 2.0\nSo, it will take 2.0 days for all the puppies to be adopted.\nTherefore, the answer is 2.0 days.")

Let's assume that you removed half of the total number of fleas in his ears, which is a reasonable assumption since you only cleaned out his ears.\nSo, half of the total number of fleas in Harry Hound's ears is 121 / 2 = 60.5 fleas.\nStep 3: Find out how many fleas perished.\nSince you cleaned out half of the total number of fleas in Harry Hound's ears, the remaining fleas are 60.5 - 36 = 24.5 fleas.\nNow, we need to find out how many of these fleas perished. We are told that you cleaned out Harry Hound's ears, which means that some of the fleas may have died as a result of the cleaning process. Let's assume that 50% of the fleas that were left in Harry Hound's ears after cleaning died, which is a reasonable assumption since cleaning ears can be a bit uncomfortable for fleas.\nSo, the number of fleas that perished is 24.5 x 0.5 = 12.25 fleas.\nTherefore, a total of 12.25 fleas per")

(5801, " Great! Let's solve this problem step by step.\n1. First, we need to convert the number of fleas in Harry Hound's ears to a decimal format. We can do this by dividing the number of fleas by 100, since there are 100 fleas in a frisky party and 1000 fleas in a baby flea's sleep.\nSo, the number of fleas in Harry Hound's right ear is 36 / 100 = 0.36, and the number of fleas in his left ear is 85 / 100 = 0.85.\n2. Next, we need to find out how many fleas perished during the cleaning process. We can do this by subtracting the number of fleas before the cleaning from the number of fleas after the cleaning.\nThe number of fleas after the cleaning is 0.36 + 0.85 = 1.21.\nSo, the number of fleas perished during the cleaning process is 1.21 - 0.36 = 0.85.\nTherefore, 85 fleas perished during the cleaning process.")

(6080, " If the price of petroleum oil went up by 10.0%, and the consumer reduced their oil consumption by the same percentage, then the consumer's petroleum bill will be changed by a different percentage.\nLet's break it down step by step:\n1. The price of petroleum oil increased by 10.0%. This means that the cost of one unit of oil is now 10.0% higher than it was before.\n2. The consumer reduced their oil consumption by the same percentage (10.0%). This means that the consumer is using 10.0% less oil than they were before the price increase.\n3. To find the new cost of the consumer's petroleum bill, we need to multiply the cost of one unit of oil by the number of units the consumer is consuming. If the consumer is consuming 10.0% less oil, then the new cost of their petroleum bill can be found by multiplying the original cost of oil by 0.90 (1 - 0.10).\nSo, if the original cost of oil was $100 per unit, the new cost of the consumer's petroleum bill would be:\n$100 x 0.90 = $90 per unit\nTherefore, the consumer's petroleum bill will be changed by a decrease of 10.0% ($100 - $90 = $10).")

The total points scored by Paige's team was 41.0 points.\n3. Paige scored 11.0 points.\n4. Everyone else on the team scored 6.0 points each.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use this information to find the number of players on Paige's team:\nIf Paige scored 11.0 points and everyone else scored 6.0 points each, that means that the total number of points scored by everyone else on the team is 41.0 - 11.0 = 30.0 points.\nSince there are more than one player on Paige's team, we know that the total number of points scored by all the players on the team is 30.0 points divided by the number of players on the team.\nSo, if we divide 30.0 points by the number of players on the team, we get the number of players on Paige's team:\n30.0 points ÷ number of players = number of players\nNow, we need to find out how many players were on Paige's team. Let's plug the values we know into the equation:\n30.0 points ÷ number of players = number of players\nnumber of players = 30.0 points ÷ number of players\nnumber of players = 30.0 points / 4 players\nnumber of players = 7.5 players\n\nSo, there were 7.5 players on Paige's team!

To find the average speed of the entire trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and then divide it by the total time taken.\nLet's start by finding the total distance traveled:\nDistance = Speed x Time\n\nFor the trip to California:\nDistance = 50.0 miles/hour x (time taken) = ?\nFor the return trip:\nDistance = 60.0 miles/hour x (time taken) = ?\n\nWe know that the total time taken for the trip to California and back is 10 hours. So, we can plug in the values as follows:\nFor the trip to California:\nDistance = 50.0 miles/hour x 10 hours = 500 miles\nFor the return trip:\nDistance = 60.0 miles/hour x 10 hours = 600 miles\n\nNow, we need to find the average speed of the entire trip. We can do this by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken:\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n\nAverage speed = 500 miles / 10 hours = 50 miles per hour\n\nSo, the average speed of the trip to California and back is 50 miles per hour.")
