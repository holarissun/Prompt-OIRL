This means that the amount of rain on Tuesday is x - 0.7 inches.\nSo, the total amount of rain on Tuesday is:\nx - 0.7 = 0.9\nNow, we need to solve for x, the amount of rain on Monday.

(1672, " Great! Let's break down the problem step by step:\n1. The builder has already installed 8.0 windows, which means there are 14.0 - 8.0 = 6.0 windows left to install.\n2. It takes 8.0 hours to install each window, so the total hours required to install the remaining windows is 6.0 windows x 8.0 hours/window = 48.0 hours.\nTherefore, it will take the builder 48.0 hours to install the remaining 6.0 windows.")

(1673, " Great, let's do this!\n\nTo find out how many eggs each student will get if they are divided equally among the 7 students, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of students.\nTotal number of eggs = 56 eggs\nNumber of students = 7 students\n\nTo divide the eggs equally among the 7 students, we can divide the total number of eggs by 7:\n56 eggs ÷ 7 students = 8 eggs per student\n\nSo, each student will get 8 eggs.")

(1674, " Great! Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Marie can bike at a speed of 12.0 miles per hour.\nSo, if Marie bikes for x hours, she will have traveled x x 12.0 miles.\n2. Marie has 31.0 hours to bike.\nSo, if Marie bikes for 31.0 hours, she will have traveled 31.0 x 12.0 = 372.0 miles.\nTherefore, Marie can bike 372.0 miles in 31.0 hours.")

(1676, " To find out how much money Zoe would have made, we need to use the information given in the problem.\n1. Each chocolate bar costs $6.00.\n2. A box has 13.0 bars in total.\n3. Zoe sold all but 6.0 bars.\n\nNow, let's use these pieces of information to find out how much money Zoe would have made:\nTotal cost of 13 bars = 13 x $6.00 = $78.00\nZoe sold 6 bars, so she kept $78.00 - $6.00 = $72.00.\nTherefore, Zoe would have made $72.00.")
