(174, " Great problem! Let's break it down step by step:\n1. Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, so he will need to make 9 / 8 = 1.125 trips to pick up the 9 trays from the first table. Since he can only carry 8 trays at a time, he will make 125 / 8 = 15.625 trips to pick up all the trays from the first table.\n2. Now, let's consider the 7 trays from the second table. Since Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make 7 / 8 = 0.875 trips to pick up all the trays from the second table.\n3. To find out how many total trips Jerry will make, we need to add the number of trips he will make for each table. So, the total number of trips Jerry will make is 15.625 + 0.875 = 16.5 trips.\nTherefore, Jerry will make 16 trips to pick up all the lunch trays.")

Since Amanda walked at a rate of 4 miles per hour, she covered 4 x 120 minutes = 480 miles during the 2 hours she walked.\n4. To find the distance between Amanda's house and Kimberly's house, we need to use the formula: distance = rate x time. In this case, the rate is 4 miles per hour, and the time is 2 hours. So, the distance between Amanda's house and Kimberly's house is:\ndistance = 4 miles/hour x 2 hours = 8 miles\nTherefore, the distance between Amanda's house and Kimberly's house is 8 miles.")

Jones High School on a Monday after a significant snow fall was 218.0. To calculate this, we can use the formula:\nNumber of students absent = Total number of students x Percentage of students absent\nWe are given that the total number of students was 1487.0, so we can plug this value into the formula:\nNumber of students absent = 1487.0 x 0.218\nNumber of students absent = 312.36\n\nLayer 2: Calculate the total number of students who attend B. Jones High School\nWe know that the total attendance on that Monday was 1487.0, so the total number of students who attend B. Jones High School is:\nTotal number of students = Total attendance\nTotal number of students = 1487.0\n\nLayer 3: Find the answer to the problem\nNow that we have the number of students absent and the total number of students who attend B. Jones High School, we can find the answer to the problem by subtracting the number of students absent from the total number of students who attend:\nTotal number of students attending B. Jones High School = Total number of students who attend - Number of students absent\nTotal number of students attending B. Jones High School = 1487.0 - 312.36\nTotal number of students attending B.

This means that the total amount of grain on the ship is restored to its original amount.\nLayer 4: Only 918.0 tons of grain remain onboard.\nThe problem states that only 918.0 tons of grain remain onboard, which means that the total amount of grain on the ship is reduced by 49952.0 - 918.0 = 48034.0 tons.\nSo, to summarize, the ship originally contained 48034.0 tons of grain.")

Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Determine the total number of bananas Ernest has:\n45.0 bananas\n\nStep 2: Find out how many boxes Ernest needs to use:\nIf Ernest has 45.0 bananas and there are 5.0 boxes, then Ernest needs 9.0 bananas per box (45.0 ÷ 5.0 = 9.0).\n\nStep 3: Determine how many cookies Julie brought to share with Ernest:\n3.0 cookies\n\nStep 4: Find out how many bananas Julie brought to share with Ernest:\nIf Julie brought 3.0 cookies and each cookie contains 0.6 bananas (a common ratio), then Julie brought 1.8 bananas (3.0 × 0.6 = 1.8).\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total number of bananas Ernest and Julie have together:\nErnest has 9.0 bananas per box, and he needs 4 boxes to store all his bananas (9.0 × 4 = 36.0 bananas). Julie brought 1.8 bananas, so together Ernest and Julie have 36.0 + 1.8 = 37.8 bananas.\n\nStep 6: Determine how many bananas must go in each box:\nTo find out how many bananas must go in each box, we divide the total number of bananas Ernest and Julie have (37.8 bananas) by the number of boxes Ernest needs to use (4 boxes). So, each box must contain:\n37.8 ÷ 4 = 9.4 bananas per box\n\nTherefore, Ernest must put away 9.4 bananas in each box.")

(1676, " Great problem! Let's break it down layer by layer:\n\nLayer 1: Cost of each chocolate bar\nThe problem states that each chocolate bar costs $6.0.\nLayer 2: Number of chocolate bars in a box\nThe problem states that a box has 13.0 bars total.\nLayer 3: Number of bars sold by Zoe\nThe problem states that Zoe sold all but 6.0 bars. This means she sold 6.0 bars and kept 6.0 bars.\nLayer 4: Calculating the total amount of money made\nTo find the total amount of money made, we need to multiply the number of bars sold by the cost of each bar.\nSo, the total amount of money made = Number of bars sold x Cost of each bar\n= 6.0 bars x $6.0\n= $36.0\n\nTherefore, Zoe made $36.0 by selling 6.0 bars of chocolate.")
