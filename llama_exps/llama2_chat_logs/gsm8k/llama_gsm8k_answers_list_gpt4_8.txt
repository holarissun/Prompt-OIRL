Since Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from one pound of beeswax, and each candle requires 1/4 pound of beeswax, we can calculate the cost of beeswax as follows:\nCost of beeswax = Number of candles / Amount of beeswax needed per candle = 20 candles / 1/4 pound per candle = $5.00 per pound\nSo, the cost of beeswax for 20 candles is $5.00 per pound.\n2. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the wicks. Since Charlie can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, and each candle requires 1 wick, we can calculate the cost of the wicks as follows:\nCost of wicks = Number of candles / Number of wicks needed per candle = 20 candles / 1 wick per candle = $2.00 per wick\nSo, the cost of the wicks for 20 candles is $2.00 per wick.\n3. Now, let's calculate the total cost of supplies:\nTotal cost of supplies = Cost of beeswax + Cost of wicks = $5.00 per pound x 20 candles = $100.00 + $2.00 per wick x 20 candles = $40.00\nSo, the total cost of supplies for 20 candles is $100.00 + $40.00 =")

As he is putting the cookies out to cool, he drops 5 of them. So, the total number of cookies he has now is (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10.\n4. Now, we know that Henry has a total of 110 cookies. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 10 = 110.\n5. To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 100.\n6. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 50.\n7.

To find out how much water the boat took on during that 16 seconds, we can multiply the distance rowed (20 feet) by the rate at which the boat was taking on water (2 liters per 10 feet): 20 feet x 2 liters/10 feet = 0.4 liters.\n4. Since Julia had to row 64 seconds to reach shore, and she took on 0.4 liters of water every 16 seconds, we can calculate the total amount of water the boat took on by multiplying the time it took her to reach shore by the rate at which she was taking on water: 64 seconds x 0.4 liters/16 seconds = 1.6 liters.\nTherefore, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 1.6 liters of water.")

So, the total time for their team will be:\n55 seconds + 55 seconds + 55 seconds + 55 seconds = 260 seconds\n2. The second team is less well-rounded, and their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. So, the total time for their team's first leg will be:\n60 seconds + 55 seconds (the time for the second runner) + 50 seconds (the time for the third runner) + 45 seconds (the time for the fourth runner) = 300 seconds\n3. Since each subsequent runner on the second team is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner, we can calculate the time for each runner as follows:\n4th runner: 300 seconds - 3 seconds = 297 seconds\nNow, let's compare the times for the two teams:\nFaster team: 260 seconds\nLess well-rounded team: 300 seconds (first leg) + 297 seconds (second leg) = 597 seconds\nSo, the faster team will win by 47 seconds (260 seconds - 597 seconds).")

The number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot redwood tree:\nThe problem states that the redwood tree is 200 feet tall. Since there are 12 feet in a foot, we can convert the height of the tree to feet as follows:\n200 feet = 24 sections of 10 feet each (since there are 12 feet in a foot)\nSo, the number of 10-foot sections in the redwood tree is:\n24 sections\n3. The weight of the redwood tree after 30% of the wood has been eaten by termites:\nThe problem states that termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. To find the weight of the tree after the termites have eaten 30% of the wood, we need to calculate the weight of the remaining wood.\nLet's assume that the termites ate 30% of the total weight of the wood in the tree. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, the total weight of the wood in the tree is:\n400 pounds x 24 sections = 10,000 pounds\nNow, if 30% of the wood has been eaten by termites, the weight of the remaining wood is:\n10,000 pounds x 70% = 7,000 pounds\nSo, the weight of the redwood tree after 30% of the wood has been eaten by termites is:\n7")

Since they have $10$ times less medals than have been given out for counting, they have won:\n$$\\frac{10}{22} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nmedals together.\nSo, Ali and Izzy together have won $4$ medals.\nNow, let's find out how many medals have been given out for counting. Since the total number of medals given out is equal to the number of medals won by Ali and Izzy, we can write:\n$$4 = \\text{Total number of medals given out for counting}$$\nSo, the total number of medals given out for counting is:\n$$4$$\nmedals.\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is:\n$$\\boxed{4}$$\nmedals.")

It takes 240 minutes of walking to break in a new pair of shoes.\n2. Jason wants to try out for the track team in three weeks.\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can set up the following equation:\nTime = 240 minutes / Number of days\nSince Jason plans to walk 4 days a week, we can substitute this value into the equation:\nTime = 240 minutes / 4 days\nTo find out how long Jason needs to spend walking each day, we can divide both sides of the equation by the number of days he will walk:\nTime = 240 minutes / 4 days\nTime = 60 minutes per day\n\nTherefore, Jason needs to spend 60 minutes walking each day for 3 weeks to break in his new shoes.')

If there are 10 total classes, then the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents stop signing him up is:\n10 classes - (10x dollars / $10 per class) = 10 - (10x / $10) classes\nSo, we can see that if Manny misses more than 10 classes (or 100% of the classes), his parents won't sign him up again.\nNow, let's solve for x (the cost of each class) to find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents stop signing him up:\n10 - (10x / $10) = 10 - (10x / $10)\nx = $100\nSo, Manny can miss up to 10 classes (or $100) before his parents stop signing him up.")

To do this, we can use the following formula:\nPercent of total water used for non-industrial purposes = (Total water used by the city - Water used for industrial purposes) / Total water in the river\nPlugging in the values we know, we get:\nPercent of total water used for non-industrial purposes = (32% - 80%) / 100% = -58%\nSo, the city uses 58% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.")

So, the total number of fish in the pond is:\n7 (initial fish) + 3 (orange fish) = 10\n2. Bob wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. The sales assistant dipped out 17 fish from a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. Let's assume that the number of white fish in the tank was x.\nSo, the total number of fish that Bob bought from the pet store is:\n17 (fish bought from the store) + x (white fish bought from the store) = ?\n3. When Bob got the new fish home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, the number of orange fish in the pond after adding the new fish is:\n2 (number of orange fish after adding new fish) = ?\nNow, we can use the information we have to find out how many white fish Bob bought at the store:\nx = 2 (number of orange fish after adding new fish) - 3 (initial orange fish)\nx = 2 - 3\nx = -1\nSo, Bob bought -1 white fish at the store.\nTherefore, Bob bought -1 white fish at the store.")

Calculate the fuel consumption of Andy's car per week:\nWe know that Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 MPG, so the fuel consumption per week is:\nFuel consumption = Distance / Fuel efficiency = 25 miles / 10 MPG = 2.5 gallons/week\n3. Calculate the cost of fuel for Andy's car per week:\nIf the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, the cost of fuel for Andy's car per week is:\nCost = Fuel consumption x Price = 2.5 gallons/week x $3/gallon = $7.50/week\nTherefore, Andy's car consumes $7.50 worth of fuel per week if he only uses it to go to work from Monday to Friday and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles.")

In the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, if Tasha mowed Joe's lawn x times, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times.\n3. In the second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, if Tasha mowed Joe's lawn x times, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.\n4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.\nNow, let's use these pieces of information to find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales:\nTotal amount earned from mowing lawns = 80\nSince Tasha mowed Joe's lawn x times in the first week, she earned $6x for mowing Joe's lawn.\nIn the second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5x times as many times as she did Joe's lawn. So, she earned $6(5x) = $30 for mowing Alba's lawn.\nTotal amount earned from mowing lawns = $6x + $30 = $90\nNow, let's find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales:\nTotal amount earned from lemonade sales = $80 - $90 = -$10\nSince Tasha made -$10 from lemonade sales, she must have made $8")
