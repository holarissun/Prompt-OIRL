(1, " Great, let's approach this problem logically! To find the total number of bolts required to make a robe, we need to calculate the total amount of blue fiber and white fiber needed, and then divide that by the amount of blue fiber required per bolt. Here are the steps:\n1. Determine the amount of blue fiber needed for the robe:\nThe problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. So, to make one robe, we need 2 x 1 bolt = 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n2. Determine the amount of white fiber needed for the robe:\nThe problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. So, if the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it takes 2 x 0.5 = 1 bolt of white fiber.\n3. Calculate the total amount of fiber needed for the robe:\nTo calculate the total amount of fiber needed for the robe, we add the amount of blue fiber and white fiber: 2 bolts + 1 bolt = 3 bolts.\n4. Determine the number of bolts required for the robe:\nNow that we know the total amount of fiber needed for the robe, we can divide that by the amount of blue fiber required per bolt to find the number of bolts: 3 bolts / 2 bolts per bolt = 1.5 bolts.\nTherefore, it takes 1.5 bolts of fiber to make one robe.")

Here are the steps to approach this problem:\n1. Determine the rate at which Dana can run:\nWe know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so if she can walk at a rate of speed x miles per hour, she can run at a rate of speed 4x miles per hour.\n2. Determine the rate at which Dana can skip:\nWe know that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, so if she can run at a rate of speed 4x miles per hour, she can skip at a rate of speed 2x miles per hour.\n3. Find the time Dana spends running and walking:\nWe know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, if she spends a total of 6 hours traveling, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.\n4. Calculate the distance traveled by Dana in six hours:\nTo calculate the distance traveled by Dana in six hours, we need to multiply the rate at which she travels (either running or walking) by the time she spends traveling.\nFor running: Distance = Speed x Time = 4x miles/hour x 2 hours = 8x miles\nFor walking: Distance = Speed x Time = x miles/hour x 4 hours = 4x miles\nNow, we need to find the average distance traveled by Dana in six hours by adding the distance traveled while running and walking and dividing by 2")

So, if Jonathan has x toys, he needs 400 - x toys to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set.\nStep 4: Solve the equation to find out how many toys Jonathan currently has.\nWe can solve the equation by subtracting x from 400:\n400 - x = 2\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 400:\nx = 200\nSo, Jonathan currently has 200 toys.\nThere")

We can use this information to calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.\nLet's assume that the number of blue jelly beans is x. Since the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is x - 1%.\nNow, the note also says that the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. So, the number of green jelly beans is x + 1%.\nWe can simplify these equations by using the fact that the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.\nx + (x - 1%) + (x + 1%) = 4500\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n2x + 1 = 4500\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 2250\nSo, there are 2250 blue jelly beans in the jar.\nStep 2: Find the number of green jelly beans\nNow that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans using the equation:\nNumber of green jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans - Number of blue jelly beans\n")

In the second month, Ariadne sold 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Since the total sales in the first month were $800, that means she sold $800 x 3/4 = $600 hats in the second month.\n4. To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we add the amount she sold in each month: $800 + $600 = $1,400.\nTherefore, Ariadne made a total of $1,400 in two months.")

Calculate the cost of fuel per week:\nCost of fuel per week = Fuel consumption per week x Price of gas per gallon\nIn this case, the price of gas is $3/gallon, so the cost of fuel per week = 35 miles/week x $3/gallon = $105 per week.\nTherefore, Andy's car is consuming $105 per week in fuel, assuming he only uses it to go to work from Monday to Friday and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles.")

So, if the room's initial temperature was T0, after 1 hour of running on high, the temperature would be:\nT1 = T0 - (3 x 1) = T0 - 3\nStep 3: Calculate the temperature change per hour when the air conditioner was off.\nThe problem states that the room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. So, if the air conditioner was off for 2 hours, the temperature would increase by:\nT2 = T0 + (2 x 2) = T0 + 4\nStep 4: Calculate the final temperature of the room after the air conditioner was turned on and off.\nWe know that the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, so the final temperature of the room after 5 hours of running (3 hours on low + 4 hours on high) would be:\nTfinal = T3 = T1 + T2 = T0 - 2 + T0 + 4 =")

(991, " Yes, you're right! To find the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time, we can use the information given in the problem. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years:\nSo, if Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, then Comet Halley was 30 + 75 = 105 years old when Bill saw it for the first time.\n2. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet:\nSo, if Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, then Bill was 3 x 30 = 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.\nTherefore, Bill was 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.")

(992, " Yes, you're right! To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we can break it down into the different payments he makes on a regular basis:\n1. Electric bill: He writes a check once per month, so he writes 12 checks per year (1 check/month x 12 months/year).\n2. Gas bill: He also writes a check once per month, so he writes 12 checks per year (1 check/month x 12 months/year).\n3. Church: He writes two checks per month, so he writes 24 checks per year (2 checks/month x 12 months/year).\n4. Pest and lawn service: He writes a check quarterly, so he writes 4 checks per year (1 check/quarter x 4 quarters/year).\nAdding up all these numbers, we get:\n12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.\nSo, Buford writes 52 checks per year.")

(993, " Great! Let's break it down step by step:\n1. The first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights. This means that the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 of the total number of flights.\n2. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means that the number of flights to France is equal to the number of flights to Germany, and both are a fraction of the total number of flights.\n3. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and it makes 44 trips in total. This means that the number of flights to Poland is 44.\n4. The first plane makes a total of x flights in one day. Since the other plane flies exclusively to Poland, we can subtract the number of flights to Poland (44) from the total number of flights to get the number of flights made by the first plane.\nSo, the number of flights to France made by the first plane in one day is:\nx - (44/2) = x - 22\nTherefore, the first plane takes 22 flights to France in one day.")

(994, " Great! Let's break down the problem step by step:\n1. Tobias's howls last for 20 seconds each.\n2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote's howls last for 40 seconds each.\n3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. Since Tobias and Chikote's howls together last for 60 seconds (20 + 40 = 60), Igneous howls for 60 seconds.\nNow, let's find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls:\nTobias's howls: 20 seconds x 3 = 60 seconds\nChikote's howls: 40 seconds x 2 = 80 seconds\nIgneous's howls: 60 seconds\nSo, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is: 60 + 80 + 60 = 190 seconds, or 3.16 minutes.\nTherefore, the answer is 3 minutes and 16 seconds.")

(995, " Great! Let's approach this problem logically:\nStep 1: Identify the information given in the problem\nThe problem states that Adam bought some new trousers for $30, and his mother gave him $6 for this purpose. It also states that his father gave him twice as much as his mother.\nStep 2: Define the variables\nLet's define the variables to make the problem easier to solve:\nAdam's initial money = A\nMoney given by his mother = M\nMoney given by his father = F\nAdam's total money = A + M + F\nStep 3: Write the equation\nWe know that Adam contributed $30 towards the purchase of the trousers, so let's write an equation:\nA = $30\nStep 4: Add the equation for the money given by his mother and father\nWe know that his mother gave him $6, so let's add this to the equation:\nA + M = $36\nWe also know that his father gave him twice as much as his mother, so let's write an equation for the money given by his father:\nF = 2M\nStep 5: Solve the system of equations\nNow, let's solve the system of equations by substituting the value of M from the first equation into the second equation:\nA + M = $36\nSubstituting M = $6, we get:\nA + $6 = $36\nA = $30\nSo, Adam had to contribute $30 from his savings towards the purchase of the trousers.\nTherefore, the answer is $30.")

(996, " Great! Let's approach this problem step by step:\n1. Let's first find the average age of the group of children. We can do this by adding the ages of all the children and dividing by the number of children.\nAverage age = (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4\nAverage age = (3 + 4 + x + Wilfred's age) / 4\nwhere x is the age of Wilfred.\n2. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can say that Helene's age is 2 times the average age.\nHelene's age = 2 x average age\n3. Now, we are given that the total age of the children is 20.\nTotal age = Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age\nTotal age = 3 + 4 + x + Wilfred's age\n4. Finally, we can use the first equation to find the age of Wilfred:\nWilfred's age = total age - (average age x 4)\nWilfred's age = 20 - (2 x average age)\nSolving for Wilfred's age, we get:\nWilfred's age = 20 - 4 x average age\nWilfred's age = 20 - 4(6)\nWilfred's age = 20 - 24\nWilfred's age = -4\nThis means that Wilfred is 4 years old.")

(999, ' Great! Let\'s approach this problem logically. Here are the steps to find the percentage of watermelon each adult gets:\nStep 1: Define the problem\nWe are given a watermelon that needs to be divided among 6 people, including 2 adults and 4 kids. Each adult wants a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.\nStep 2: Find the total area of the watermelon\nWe need to find the total area of the watermelon that each person will get. Since the watermelon is a cylinder, we can use the formula for the area of a cylinder:\nArea = πr² + 2πrh\nwhere r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height.\nWe are given that the watermelon is divided into 6 equal parts, so the radius of the cylinder is half the length of the watermelon.
