(38, " Great, let's break it down step by step to solve this problem!\n1. John runs 60 miles per week.\n2. John runs 3 days a week.\n3. On the first day, John runs for 3 hours.\n4. On the other two days, John runs for half as much time as he runs on the first day.\n5. To find out how fast John runs on the other two days, we can use the formula:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nwhere Time is the time John runs, Distance is the distance he runs, and Speed is his running speed.\nSo, if John runs for 3 hours on the first day, his speed is:\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 60 miles / 3 hours = 20 miles per hour\nNow, let's find out how fast John runs on the other two days:\nDay 2:\nTime = Distance / Speed = 60 miles / (20 miles per hour x 0.5) = 4 hours\nSo, John runs for 4 hours on the second day.\nDay 3:\nTime = Distance / Speed = 60 miles / (20 miles per hour x 0.5) = 4 hours\nSo, John runs for 4 hours on the third day as well.\nTherefore, John runs at a speed of 20 miles per hour.")

(39, " Sure, let's break it down step by step to solve this problem:\n1. Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. This means that if she can walk at a rate of speed x miles per hour, she can run at a rate of speed 4x miles per hour.\n2. Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. This means that if she can run at a rate of speed 4x miles per hour, she can skip at a rate of speed 2x miles per hour.\n3. If Dana can skip at a rate of speed 3 miles per hour, we know that she can run at a rate of speed 4x miles per hour, since running is four times faster than skipping.\n4. If Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can use the formula:\nTotal distance traveled = (Time running x Speed running) + (Time walking x Speed walking)\nIn this case, the time spent running is 1/3 of 6 hours = 2 hours, and the time spent walking is 6 - 2 = 4 hours. The speed at which Dana runs is 4x miles per hour, and the speed at which she walks is x miles per hour.\nSo, the total distance traveled by Dana in six hours can be calculated as follows:\nTotal distance = (2 hours x 4x miles per hour) + (4 hours x x miles per hour)\n= 8x miles + 16x miles\n= 24x miles\nTherefore, Dana can travel 24x miles in six hours, where x is the speed at which she can walk.")

Since the fog bank rolls in from the ocean, let\'s call the distance from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge of the city "x" miles.\n2. Since the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, we can calculate the time it takes to cover a 3-mile segment as follows:\nTime = 10 minutes / 3 miles = 3.33 minutes per mile\n3. Now, we need to find out how many miles the fog bank covers in 10 minutes. To do this, we can divide the distance "x" by the time it takes to cover 3 miles:\nMiles covered = x / 3 minutes = x / 3 x 60 = x / 180\n4. Now that we know how many miles the fog bank covers in 10 minutes, we can find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city. We can do this by multiplying the distance of the city (42 miles) by the time it takes to cover a mile (3.33 minutes per mile):\nTime = 42 miles x 3.33 minutes/mile = 140.66 minutes\n5. Finally, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours to find out how long the fog bank will take to cover the whole city.

We know they made $25 in profit, and we want to find out how many gallons of lemonade they sold to make that much money.\nSo, let's use the information given in the problem:\n* Each glass of lemonade costs $0.50\n* They sell 20 glasses per gallon\n* The total cost of lemons and sugar for each gallon is $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5\n* Therefore, they make $0.50 per glass - $5 per gallon = $4.50 per gallon\nNow, we can use this information to find out how many gallons they sold:\n$25 (profit) / $4.50 (per gallon) = 5.5 gallons\nSo, Juan and Carlos sold 5.5 gallons of lemonade to make $25 in profit.\n2. Next, we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. We know they spent $3 per gallon on lemons, so we can use this information to find out how much they spent on lemons for the 5.5 gallons they sold:\n$3 (per gallon) x 5.5 (gallons sold) = $16.50\nSo, Juan and Carlos spent $16.50 on lemons for the 5.5 gallons of lemonade they sold.\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is $16.50.")

(211, ' Great, let\'s solve this problem step by step!\n1. We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.\n2. We are also given that the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day.\n3. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens must be greater than the number of red chickens. Let\'s call the number of red chickens "R" and the number of white chickens "W".\n4. We know that the total number of chickens Jerry has is equal to the number of red chickens plus the number of white chickens, so we can write:\nR + W = 2W\n5. Now, we are also given that Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by all of Jerry\'s chickens is:\n3R + 5W\n6. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we know that the total number of eggs produced by all of Jerry\'s chickens must be less than or equal to 42.\n7. Now, we can substitute the values we know into the equation:\n3R + 5W ≤ 42\n8. Since W is greater than R, we can simplify the equation:\n3R + 5W ≤ 42\n9. Now, we can solve for R by subtracting 5W from both sides of the equation:\n2R + W ≤ 42\n10. Now, we can solve for R by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\nR ≤ 21\n11.

Next, we need to find the time it takes Gary to walk one mile. We are given that he walks at 3 miles per hour, so we can use this information to find the time it takes him to walk one mile.\nTime = Distance / Speed = 6 miles / 3 miles/hour = 2 hours\n3. Now, we need to find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park. Since the park is a rectangle, the area he walks around is the perimeter of the park. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all the sides. In this case, the perimeter of the park is 1.5 miles + 1.5 miles + 6 miles + 6 miles = 15 miles.\n4. Since Gary walks around the edge of the park, he walks the perimeter of the park. To find the time it takes him to walk the perimeter, we can use the information we found in step 2.\nTime = Distance / Speed = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours\nTherefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the local park.")

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her French fries, which we can assume is a small number, let's say 5.\n5. Colby took 3 less than the number of French fries that Kyle took, so Colby took 3 - 5 = -2 French fries from Griffin. (Note: since Colby took fewer fries than Kyle, this means that Griffin actually gained fries in this step)\n6. To find out how many French fries Griffin had at the end, we need to add up all the fries that were taken or given to him: 19 + 10 + 5 + 3 = 37 French fries.\n7.

We know that $2 is half of the $10 that Billy had originally, so if he spent $2 on gumballs, that means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left to spend on candy.\n6. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, and Billy has $8 to spend, he can buy a total of $8 / $1.5 = 5.33 pounds of candy.\n7.

If 50 cats were on the rock to begin with, and 25 cats were carried away by the boats, that means there were 25 cats left on the rock. If 3/5 of those cats (which is 30 cats) ran after the mouse, that means there are 5 cats left on the rock.\nGreat! Our answer checks out. There are 5 cats left on the rock after the boats carried away 25 cats and 30 cats ran after a mouse.")

Bill signed up for the service at an introductory price of $8 per month for the first 6 months.\nCost for the first 6 months = $8 x 6 months = $48\n2. After the introductory period, the price increased to $12 per month for the next 2 months (8 - 6 = 2 months).\nCost for the next 2 months = $12 x 2 months = $24\nTotal cost for the first 8 months = $48 + $24 = $72\n3. Then, the price increased again to $14 per month for the next 2 months (8 - 6 = 2 months).\nCost for the next 2 months = $14 x 2 months = $28\nTotal cost for the first 10 months = $72 + $28 = $100\n4.

To do this, we multiply the number of muffins Kate can make by the price she wants to sell each muffin for:\n24 muffins x $1.50 per muffin = $36.00\n3. Finally, we need to subtract any costs Kate may have incurred to make the muffin crayons. For example, if Kate had to buy an oven to melt the crayons, she would need to subtract the cost of the oven from the money she made selling the muffin crayons.

Pete wants to buy 90 contacts, which means he will pay $90.00 for them (90 x $100.00 = $9000.00).\n3. The cost of each contact is $100.00, so the cost of 90 contacts is $9000.00 / 90 contacts = $100.00 per contact.\n4. If Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts, he will pay $200.00 for the 2 boxes (2 x $100.00 = $200.00).\n5. Each box contains 90 contacts, so the total number of contacts Pete will get is 90 contacts per box x 2 boxes = 180 contacts.\n6. Since each contact costs $100.00, the total cost of the 180 contacts Pete will get is $100.00 x 180 contacts = $18,000.00.\n7. Since the box is currently 10% off, Pete will pay $18,000.00 / 10% = $16,200.00 for the 180 contacts.\nTherefore, if Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts, each pair of contacts will cost him $16,200.00 / 2 boxes = $8,100.00.")

Width of the hole:\nThe hole is 4 feet wide, which is equal to 48 inches (4 x 12 = 48).\n3. Depth of the hole:\nThe hole is 3 feet deep, which is equal to 36 inches (3 x 12 = 36).\n4. Volume of the hole:\nTo find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth:\nVolume of the hole = length x width x depth = 72 x 48 x 36 = 15,728 cubic inches\n5. Time to dig the hole:\nYou said it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Since we want to find the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to convert the volume of the hole from cubic inches to cubic feet:\n1 cubic foot = 1,728 cubic inches (12 x 12 x 12 = 1,728)\nNow, we can use the time it takes Bob to shovel a cubic foot of earth to find the time it will take him to dig the hole:\nTime to dig the hole = volume of the hole / time to shovel a cubic foot = 15,728 / 3 = 5,242 seconds\nTherefore, it will take Bob 5,242 seconds (or approximately 87 minutes) to dig the hole.")

It took them 1.5 hours to hike.\nSo, they hiked for:\n250 miles / 1.5 hours = 166.67 miles per hour\n5. Now, we can find out how far their vacation spot is by multiplying their hiking speed by the time they hiked:\n166.67 miles per hour x 1.5 hours = 249.95 miles\nTherefore, the Llesis family's vacation spot is 249.95 miles away from where they started.")

Let's assume that the number of white fish in the tank was x. Since the total number of fish in the tank was 17, the number of orange fish must be 17 - x.\n3. When Bob added the new fish to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, the number of orange fish in his pond after buying the new fish is 2x.\n4. Since Bob had 3 orange fish in his pond initially, and he now has 2x orange fish, the number of white fish in his pond must be 3 - 2x.\n5. Now, we can use the information that Bob had 7 fish in his pond initially, and he now has 10 fish in his pond.

Since he only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, the distance traveled per week is:\nDistance traveled per week = Number of workdays per week x Distance traveled per day\nDistance traveled per day = 5 miles (one-way distance between home and office) x 2 (since he makes the trip round trip)\nDistance traveled per week = 5 miles x 2 = 10 miles per week\n2. Next, we need to calculate the fuel consumption of Andy's car per week. We know that the fuel efficiency of Andy's car is 10 MPG, so the fuel consumption per mile is:\nFuel consumption per mile = 10 MPG\n3. Now, we can calculate the fuel consumption of Andy's car per week by multiplying the distance traveled per week by the fuel consumption per mile:\nFuel consumption per week = Distance traveled per week x Fuel consumption per mile\nFuel consumption per week = 10 miles x $3/gallon = $30 per week\nSo, Andy's car consumes $30 per week in fuel if he only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles.\nI hope this helps!

Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil she uses is 2x = 20 ounces.\n3. Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt she uses is 2x = 20 ounces.\n4. Since Tanya makes enough salt scrub to fill a 10-ounce jar each time, the amount of salt she uses is equal to the amount of salt in the jar, which is 10 ounces.\n5. Now we can find the amount of sugar she uses by substituting the values we know into the equation:\nSugar = Salt + Zest\nSugar = 10 ounces + x ounces\nSugar = 10 + 2x ounces\n6. Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we can say that the amount of sugar she uses is equal to the amount of salt she uses, which is 10 ounces.\n7. Now we can find the amount of oil she uses by subtracting the amount of salt and zest from the total amount of ingredients:\nOil = Total ingredients - Salt - Zest\nOil = 20 ounces - 10 ounces - 2x ounces\nOil = 8 ounces\n\nSo, Tanya uses 8 ounces of oil to make her salt scrub.')

(990, " Great, let's work through this problem step by step!\n1. The room was cooled by the air conditioner on low for 3 hours, so the temperature after 3 hours was:\nFinal temperature after 3 hours on low = 2 degrees per hour x 3 hours = 6 degrees lower than the starting temperature\n2. Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, so the temperature after 7 hours (4 hours on high + 3 hours on low) was:\nFinal temperature after 7 hours = 3 degrees per hour x 4 hours = 12 degrees lower than the starting temperature\n3. After 7 hours, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, so the final temperature after 9 hours (7 hours on high + 2 hours off) was:\nFinal temperature after 9 hours = 0 degrees per hour (no cooling effect)\n4. To find the final temperature, we need to add the temperature change during each hour:\nFinal temperature = starting temperature + (temperature change per hour x hours)\nIn this case, the starting temperature is not given, but we can assume it was the initial room temperature. So, the final temperature can be calculated as:\nFinal temperature = initial temperature + (6 degrees per hour x 3 hours) + (12 degrees per hour x 4 hours) + (0 degrees per hour x 2 hours)\n= initial temperature + 18 degrees + 48 degrees + 0 degrees\n= initial temperature + 66 degrees\n\nTherefore, the final temperature was 66 degrees lower than the starting temperature.")

(991, " Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!\n1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.\n2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.\n3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.\n4. So, if Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, and Bill is three times that age, then Bill is 90 years old (3 x 30 = 90).\nTherefore, Bill was 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.")

(992, " Sure! Let's break it down step by step to find out how many checks Buford writes per year:\n1. Buford writes a check every month to pay the electric bill. How many checks does he write for the electric bill per year?\nAnswer: 12 (since there are 12 months in a year)\n2. Buford writes a check every month for the gas bill. How many checks does he write for the gas bill per year?\nAnswer: 12 (just like the electric bill)\n3. Buford writes two checks per month to the church. How many checks does he write to the church per year?\nAnswer: 24 (since there are 12 months in a year and he writes two checks per month)\n4. Buford writes a check quarterly to the pest and lawn service. How many checks does he write to the pest and lawn service per year?\nAnswer: 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year)\nNow, let's add up the total number of checks Buford writes per year:\n12 (electric bill) + 12 (gas bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 44\nSo, Buford writes 44 checks per year.")

(993, " Great, let's break this down step by step!\n1. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means that the plane makes 3/4 of its total number of flights to Greece.\n2. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the plane makes 1/4 of its total number of flights to France and Germany combined.\n3. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and it makes 44 trips in a day. Since the total number of flights in a day is equal to the number of flights made by the first plane, we can say that the total number of flights to France is equal to the number of flights made by the first plane minus the number of flights made by the second plane to Poland.\n4. So, the number of flights to France in a day is:\n3/4 x 20 (total number of flights in a day) - 44 (total number of flights made by the second plane to Poland)\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n3/4 x 20 - 44 = ?\n6. Solving for the number of flights to France, we get:\n3/4 x 20 - 44 = 14\n7. Therefore, the first plane takes 14 flights to France in a day.\nSo, the answer is 14 flights to France in a day.")

(994, " Great, let's work this problem step by step!\n1. Tobias's howls last for 20 seconds each. How many howls does Tobias make in 1 minute?\nTobias makes 6 howls in 1 minute (20 seconds/howl x 6 howls/minute).\n2. Chikote's howls last for twice as long as Tobias's howls. How many seconds does Chikote howl for in 1 minute?\nChikote howls for 40 seconds in 1 minute (20 seconds/howl x 2 = 40 seconds/howl).\n3. Igneous's howls last for as long as the other two wolves combined. How many seconds does Igneous howl for in 1 minute?\nIgneous howls for 60 seconds in 1 minute (40 seconds + 20 seconds = 60 seconds/howl).\n4. Now, let's find the combined length of time the three wolves howl in 1 minute.\nThe combined length of time the three wolves howl is:\nTobias's howls: 6 howls x 20 seconds/howl = 120 seconds\nChikote's howls: 40 seconds\nIgneous's howls: 60 seconds\nCombined total: 120 + 40 + 60 = 220 seconds\nTherefore, the combined length of time the three wolves howl in 1 minute is 220 seconds, or 3.6 minutes.")

(996, " Great! Let's start by using the information given in the problem to find the average age of the group:\nAverage age of the group = Total age of the children / Number of children\nIn this case, the total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children playing together, so:\nAverage age of the group = 20 / 4 = 5\nNow, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. So, we can use this information to find the age of Helene:\nHelene's age = 2 x Average age of the group = 2 x 5 = 10\nNow, we know the age of Helene, and we can use the information that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old to find the age of Wilfred:\nWilfred's age = 4 (Alessandro's age) + 3 (Akbar's age) = 7\nSo, the age of Wilfred is 7 years old.")
