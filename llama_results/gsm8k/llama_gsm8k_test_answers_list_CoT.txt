Let's assume that the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.\nTo find out the profit, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. We can do this by multiplying the original value of the house by the percentage increase in value after the repairs:\nNew value = Original value x Percentage increase\nNew value = $80,000 x 150%\nNew value = $120,000\nSo, the new value of the house after the repairs is $120,000.\nNow, we need to subtract the cost of the repairs from the new value to find the profit:\nProfit = New value - Cost of repairs\nProfit = $120,000 - $50,000\nProfit = $70,000\n\nTherefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000 on the flip.

(41, ' Great, let\'s break this down step by step!\nSo, we know that the distance from Polly to the dragon is 1000 feet. We also know that when Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than when she\'s not holding it.\nLet\'s call the distance from Polly to the dragon when she\'s not holding the gemstone "d". So, d = 1000 feet.\nNow, when Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin a distance of 3d = 3(1000) = 3000 feet.\nSo, the distance from Polly to the dragon when she\'s holding the gemstone is 3000 feet.\nBut we also know that the dragon\'s flames only reach a distance of 400 feet. So, the distance from Polly to the dragon when she\'s holding the gemstone and standing outside of the dragon\'s flames is:\nd = 3000 - 400 = 2600 feet.\nTherefore, if Polly holds the sapphire gemstone and stands 2600 feet away from the dragon, she can still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.')

We know that at the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces remaining.\nSo, the number of pieces of pie that the guests took is equal to the number of pieces remaining minus the total number of pieces available. In this case, that is:\n14 pieces - 40 pieces = -26 pieces\nOh no! It looks like the guests ate too many pieces of pie! But don't worry, we can just subtract 26 pieces from the total number of pieces available to find out how many pieces the guests actually took:\n40 pieces - 26 pieces = 14 pieces\nSo, the guests took 14 pieces of pie.

If we want to know how many grams of chips we can eat based on our daily calorie target, we need to divide the total number of calories in the bag by the number of servings.\nIn this case, the bag has 5 servings, so we can calculate the number of calories in each serving as follows:\n250 calories / 5 servings = 50 calories per serving\nNow, let's check how many calories you have already consumed from the 1800 calories you mentioned. Since each serving has 50 calories, if you have already eaten 1800 calories, that means you have eaten 1800 / 50 = 36 servings of chips.\nNow, let's see how many grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target of 2000 calories:\n2000 calories - 36 x 50 calories = 1000 calories\nSince each serving has 50 calories, you can eat 1000 / 50 = 20 grams of chips.\nSo, in summary, if your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, you can eat up to 20 grams of chips based on the nutritional information provided.")

That means that if Sarah does x pounds of laundry, Raymond does (x/2) pounds of laundry.\nNow, we are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. So, we can set up the equation:\nSarah's laundry = 400 pounds\nDavid's laundry = x pounds (since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David)\nRaymond's laundry = (x/2) pounds (since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah)\nNow, we can substitute the value of x (which is 400) into the equation for Raymond's laundry:\nRaymond's laundry = (400/2) pounds = 200 pounds\nSo, the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is 200 pounds.")

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 5/6.\nNow, let's find the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, 6), so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6. If Jerry rolls an even number on the first roll, there are now 2 even numbers remaining on the die (2, 4), so the probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is 2/5.\nSo, the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) × (2/5) = 6/15 = 40%.\nNow, we can calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 compared to the probability of him rolling two even numbers in a row.

Each letter is 2 pages long, so Mike receives 10 pages of letters per week (5 letters x 2 pages per letter).\n3. Mike stops being pen pals with 2 of the people, which means he no longer receives letters from those 2 pen pals. So, the number of pages he receives from the remaining 3 pen pals is now 8 pages per week (5 - 2 = 3).\n4. Mike responds in kind to each letter he receives, which means he writes 2 pages per week for each of the 3 pen pals he is still pen pals with (8 pages received x 2 pages written per week = 16 pages written per week).\n5. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, which means he can write 16 pages per week in total (16 pages written per week / 6 minutes per page = 260 minutes per week).\n6. There are 7 days in a week, so Mike spends writing letters for 260 minutes per day (260 minutes per week / 7 days per week = 36 minutes per day).\nTherefore, Mike spends approximately 36 minutes per day writing letters to his remaining 3 pen pals.")

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.\nSo, the total number of players on the offense is 2x, and the total number of players on the defense is x.\nNow, we are given that there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense.

So, if the coffee is initially 80 degrees, after adding one ice cube, it will be 67 degrees (13 degrees cooling).\nNow, let's assume Shannon adds 12 milliliters of ice to the coffee. This will cool the coffee down by 12 degrees (since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees). So, after adding 12 milliliters of ice, the coffee will be 55 degrees (67 - 12 = 55 degrees).\nHowever, adding ice to the coffee also makes it weaker. The problem states that each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, after adding 12 milliliters of ice, the coffee will be 43 milliliters (55 - 12 = 43 milliliters).\nNow, let's consider the next step. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream to her iced coffee. This will further weaken the coffee. Since cream is less dense than coffee, it will displace some of the coffee, making it weaker. Let's assume that the cream displaces 7 milliliters of coffee (since cream is less dense than coffee, it will displace some of the coffee). So, after adding 15 milliliters of cream, the coffee will be 36 milliliters (43 - 7 = 36 milliliters).\nTherefore, when Shannon adds 65 degrees of cooling and 15 milliliters of cream to her")

We can do this by subtracting the number of pots she donated from the total number of pots she had:\nX - (30 + 2 \\* 30) = X - 120\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nX - 120 = 80\nX = 80 + 120 = 200\nSo, April has 200 plant pots left over after donating them to the local school.')

Let's call the measure of the smallest angle x degrees.\nWe are given that one angle is twice the smallest angle, so the measure of the angle opposite this angle is 2x degrees.\nWe are also given that one angle is three times the smallest angle, so the measure of the angle opposite this angle is 3x degrees.\nNow, we can use the properties of angles to find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle. Let's call the measure of the largest angle y degrees.\nWe know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write:\nx + 2x + 3x = 180\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n5x = 180\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\nx = 36\nSo, the measure of the smallest angle in the triangle is 36 degrees.\nNow, we can find the measure of the largest angle by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:\ny + x + 2x = 180\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\ny + 3x = 180\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\ny = 60\nSo, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 60 degrees.")

(716, " Great, let's break it down step by step!\n1. First, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the omelet. We know that John made himself a 6 egg omelet, so the number of eggs is 6.\n2. Next, we need to calculate the amount of cheese in the omelet. We know that the cheese is 2 oz, and we can convert this to grams by dividing by 30 (since there are 30 grams in an ounce). So, the amount of cheese in the omelet is:\n2 oz = 2 x 30 g = 60 g\n3. Now, we need to calculate the amount of ham in the omelet. We know that the ham is also 2 oz, so:\n2 oz = 2 x 30 g = 60 g\n4. Next, we need to calculate the total calories in each egg. We know that the calories in an egg are 75, so:\n75 calories/egg\n5. Now, let's calculate the total calories in the omelet by multiplying the number of eggs by the total calories in each egg:\nTotal calories in omelet = 6 eggs x 75 calories/egg = 450 calories\n6. Finally, we need to add the calories from the cheese and ham to get the total calories in the omelet. We know that the cheese has 60 g and the ham has 60 g, so:\nTotal calories in omelet = 450 calories + (60 g x 120 calories/g) + (60 g x 40 calories/g) = 450 calories + 7200 calories + 2400 calories = ")

So, the total amount of money made from selling lollipops is:\nTotal amount of money made from selling lollipops = 300 lollipops x $0.8 per lollipop = $240\nBut, we also know that the students bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, so we can calculate the profit made from selling the lollipops as follows:\nProfit made from selling lollipops = Total amount of money made from selling lollipops - Cost of buying lollipops\nIn this case, the profit made from selling lollipops is:\nProfit made from selling lollipops = $240 - $0.5 x 300 lollipops = $240 - $150 = $90\nTherefore, the class was able to raise $90 from selling lollipops.

(995, " Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\nAdam's mother gave him $6 for the trousers, so Adam received a total of $6 + $30 = $36.\nAdam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so Adam's father gave him $36 x 2 = $72.\nSo, Adam received a total of $36 + $72 = $108.\nNow, we know that Adam had to contribute $30 from his savings to buy the trousers, so we can set up the equation:\n$108 - $30 = Adam's savings\nSolving for Adam's savings, we get:\n$78\n\nTherefore, Adam had $78 left in his savings after buying the trousers.")

(996, " Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\nWe know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so we can start by finding the average age of the group. We can do this by adding the ages of all the children and dividing by 4 (the number of children).\nSo, the average age of the group is:\n3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20\nNow, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so her age is:\n2 x 20 = 40\nSo, Helene is 40 years old.\nNow, we are given that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. We can use this information to find the age of Wilfred.\nWe know that Wilfred is older than Akbar, so he must be at least 3 + 1 = 4 years old.\nAnd we know that Wilfred is younger than Alessandro, so he must be less than 4 + 1 = 5 years old.\nSo, the age of Wilfred is between 4 and 5 years old, inclusive.\nTherefore, the age of Wilfred is 4 years old.")

(999, " Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\nSo, we have a watermelon that needs to be divided among 6 people. We want each adult (2 people) to get a slice that is twice as big as the slice given to each kid (4 people).\nLet's first find out how many equal parts the watermelon can be divided into. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the watermelon by the weight of each part.\nLet's assume the weight of the watermelon is 10 kg. If we divide it into 6 equal parts, each part will weigh 1.67 kg (10 kg / 6 = 1.67 kg).\nNow, let's find out how big each slice will be. We want each adult to get a slice that is twice as big as the slice given to each kid. So, if each kid gets a slice that weighs 1.67 kg, then each adult will get a slice that weighs 3.34 kg (2 x 1.67 kg = 3.34 kg).\nTo find out the length and width of each slice, we can use the formula:\nLength = Weight / (2 x Depth)\nWidth = Weight / (2 x Depth)\nWhere depth is the thickness of each slice. Since we want the slices to be roughly the same size, let's assume the depth of each slice is about 1 cm (0.1 m).\nUsing the values we just calculated, we get:\nLength = 3.34 kg / (2 x 0.1 m) = 16.7 cm\nWidth = 3.34 kg / (2 x 0.1 m) = 16.7 cm\nSo, each adult will get a slice that is about 16.7 cm long and 16.7 cm wide.\nNow, to find out how much of the watermelon each")
