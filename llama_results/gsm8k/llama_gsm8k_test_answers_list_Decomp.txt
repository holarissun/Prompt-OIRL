(1, " Sure! Let's break down the problem into smaller sub-questions and solve them step by step:\n1. How many bolts of blue fiber does the robe take?\nSub-question: What is the ratio of blue fiber to white fiber in the robe?\nAnswer: The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. To find the ratio of blue fiber to white fiber, we can divide the number of bolts of blue fiber by the number of bolts of white fiber:\n2 bolts of blue fiber รท half the number of bolts of white fiber = 2:1\nSo the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber for every 1 bolt of white fiber.\n2. How many bolts of white fiber does the robe take?\nSub-question: What is the ratio of blue fiber to white fiber in the robe?\nAnswer: We just found out that the ratio of blue fiber to white fiber is 2:1, so we can use this ratio to find the number of bolts of white fiber:\n2 bolts of blue fiber รท 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the robe takes 1 bolt of white fiber.\n3. How many bolts of fiber does the robe take in total?\nSub-question: How many bolts of blue fiber does the robe take?\nAnswer: We just found out that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.\nSub-question: How many bolts of white fiber does the robe take?\nAnswer: We just found out that the robe takes 1 bolt of white fiber.\nSo the robe takes a total of 2 + 1 = 3 bolts of fiber.\nTherefore, the answer to the original question is 3 bolts of fiber.")

Distance traveled during the first part of the journey (1-4 PM):\nTom travels for 5 hours, so the distance traveled can be calculated as:\nDistance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 5 hours = 50 miles\n\n2. Time taken to travel back to the starting point at a rate of 6 miles per hour:\nTo find the time taken to travel back, we can use the formula:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nWe know the distance traveled during the second part of the journey is 40 miles (since Tom starts at 4 PM and travels back to the starting point), and the speed is 6 miles per hour. So, we can plug in these values to get:\nTime = 40 miles / 6 miles/hour = 6.67 hours\n\n3. Total time taken by Tom to complete his journey:\nThe total time taken by Tom to complete his journey is the sum of the time taken during the first part of the journey and the time taken during the second part of the journey:\nTotal Time = Time during first part + Time during second part\n= 50 miles / 10 miles/hour + 6.67 hours\n= 5.57 hours + 6.67 hours = 12.24 hours\n\nTherefore, Tom takes approximately 12.24 hours to complete his journey.")

Find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge.\nLet's solve each sub-question step by step:\n1. Find the weight of the truck and the driver:\nThe combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Since the driver weighs x pounds, the weight of the empty truck is 3755 - x pounds.\nWe know that the total weight of the truck and the driver must not exceed 5000 pounds, so we can set up the following equation:\n3755 - x + x = 5000\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n2x = 1250\nx = 625\nSo, the driver weighs 625 pounds and the empty truck weighs 3125 pounds (3755 - 625).\n2. Find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge:\nWe know that each box weighs 15 pounds, so the total weight of the boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is:\nTotal weight of boxes = Number of boxes x Weight of each box\n= 15 x Number of boxes\nWe want to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge, so we set up the following equation:\nTotal weight of boxes = 5000\nNumber of boxes = Total weight of boxes / Weight of each box\n= 5000 / 15\n=")

How long does each patient visit the hospital on average?\nThe problem statement tells us that each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.\n3. How much does the hospital charge for each patient visit?\nThe problem statement tells us that the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. Since each patient visit lasts for 24 minutes, we can convert the charge to a per-minute rate by dividing $200 by 24 minutes: $8.33 per minute.\n4. How much does the doctors charge for each patient visit?\nThe problem statement tells us that the doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour. Since the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, we can infer that the doctors are paid $50 per hour by the hospital ($200 - $150).\n5. How much profit does the hospital make from each patient visit?\nTo find the profit, we need to subtract the cost of the doctors' services from the revenue generated by each patient visit. The revenue generated by each patient visit is $200 per hour, and the cost of the doctors' services is $50 per hour. Therefore, the profit per patient visit is:\nProfit = Revenue - Cost = $200 - $50 = $150 per hour\nNow, to find the total profit for 500 patients per day, we need to multiply the profit per hour by the number of patients seen per day:\nTotal Profit = Profit per hour x Number of patients per day = $150 x 500 = $75,00")

Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:\nProbability = 5 / 6 = 0.83 (or 83%)\n2. Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:\nTo roll two even numbers in a row, Jerry must first roll an even number, and then roll another even number. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:\nProbability = 3 / 6 = 0.5 (or 50%)\n3. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and then rolling two even numbers in a row:\nTo find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and then rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event:\nProbability = (5 / 6) x (3 / 6) = 0.83 x 0.5 = 0.415 (or 41.5%)\nTherefore, the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 is 83%, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is")

How many apples did they both pick together?\n\nNow, let's solve each sub-question step by step:\n\n1. How many apples did Jenna pick?\n\nWe know that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. So, if her mother picked 20 apples, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.\n\n2. How many apples did her mother pick?\n\nWe know that Jenna picked 10 apples, so her mother picked 20 - 10 = 10 apples.\n\n3. How many apples did they both pick together?\n\nWe know that Jenna picked 10 apples and her mother picked 10 apples, so together they picked 10 + 10 = 20 apples.\n\nTherefore, Jenna and her mother picked 20 apples together from their apple farm.")

(186, " Sure! Let's break down the problem into smaller sub-questions and solve each one step by step:\n1. How many cages are there for the small rodents?\nWe know that the small rodents are divided into 3 groups, and each group is kept in an equal number of cages. So, the total number of cages for the small rodents is 3.\n2. How many pieces of straw are given to each rat in each cage?\nWe know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 50 (10 cages x 5 pieces/cage).\nWe also know that there are 3 groups of small rodents, and each group is kept in an equal number of cages. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the small rodents is 160 (3 groups x 50 pieces/group).\nSince there are 6 pieces of straw given to each rat in each cage, the total number of rats in each cage is:\n160 pieces of straw / 6 pieces/cage = 26.67 rats/cage (round up to 27 rats/cage)\n3. How many rabbits are in the pen?\nWe know that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. So, there must be 20/6 = 3.33 rabbits in the pen (round up")

So, the total number of eggs produced by all the chickens per day is 3x + 5(x + 2).\nNow, let's equate this to the number of eggs Jerry collects every day: 42.\nSolving for x, we get:\n3x + 5(x + 2) = 42\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n3x + 10x + 10 = 42\nCombinging like terms, we get:\n13x + 1")

Since he walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, the distance he covers in one hour is:\nDistance = Speed x Time\n= 3 miles/hour x 1 hour\n= 3 miles\n\nSo, in one hour, Gary covers a distance of 3 miles.\n2. How many hours does Gary spend walking?\nNow, we need to find out how many hours it takes Gary to walk the entire perimeter of the park. Since the park is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles, its perimeter is:\nPerimeter = 2 x (length + width)\n= 2 x (1.5 miles + 6 miles)\n= 2 x 7.5 miles\n\nSince Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, it will take him:\nTime = Distance / Speed\n= 7.5 miles / 3 miles/hour\n= 2.5 hours\n\nSo, Gary spends 2.5 hours walking around the edge of the park.")

(240, " Sure! Let's break down the problem into smaller sub-questions and solve them step by step:\n1. How many candies does James have?\nWe know that James has 6 more candies than Robert, so if Robert has x candies, James has x + 6 candies.\n2. How many candies does John have?\nWe know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so if Robert has x candies, John has 2x candies.\n3. How many more candies does John have than James?\nWe are given that John has 54 candies, and James has x + 6 candies. So, we can find the difference between John's candies and James' candies by subtracting x + 6 from 54:\n54 - (x + 6) = ?\n4. What is the value of x?\nWe can solve for x by using the information given in the problem. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so John's candies are 2x. We also know that James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James' candies are x + 6. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n2x = 54 - (x + 6)\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n2x = 48\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\nx = 24\n\nSo, James has 24 candies, John has 104 candies (2x), and John has 40 more candies than James (54 - 24 = 40).")

(265, " Sure! To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to break down the problem into several sub-questions and then solve each one step by step:\n1. Calculate the selling price of the property:\nThe selling price of the property is $350,000.\n2. Calculate the brokerage fee:\nThe brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $17,500 (5% of $350,000).\n3. Calculate the transfer fee:\nThe transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is $42,000 (12% of $350,000).\n4. Calculate the total price of the house:\nThe total price of the house is the selling price plus the brokerage fee plus the transfer fee.\nSo, the total price of the house is:\n$350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $399,500\n5. Compare the total price of the house to Mrs. Cruz's budget:\nThe total price of the house is $399,500, and Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000.\nTherefore, the total price of the house is $1,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.\nSo, the answer is:\nThe total price of the house is $1,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.")

How many meals can a 42 kg bag of rice last?\nSolution: To find out how many meals a 42 kg bag of rice can last, we need to divide the weight of the rice (42 kg) by the amount of rice consumed per meal (1 kg). This gives us:\n42 kg / 1 kg = 42 meals\nSo, a 42 kg bag of rice can last for 42 meals.\n3. How many weeks will a 42 kg bag of rice last?\nSolution: Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the number of meals (42 meals) by the number of days in a week to find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:\n42 meals / 7 days = 6 weeks\nSo, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 6 weeks.\nTherefore, the answer to the original question is 6 weeks.")

How much did Davos pay for each shirt after the discount?\n\nNow, let's solve each sub-question step by step:\n1. What is the original price of each shirt before the discount?\nThe problem states that the two shirts cost $30 each, so the original price of each shirt before the discount is:\n$30 / 100 = $30 x 1 = $30\n2. What is the discount percentage?\nThe problem states that the shirts were bought with a 40% discount, so the discount percentage is:\n40% = 0.4\n3. How much did Davos pay for each shirt after the discount?\nWe know that the original price of each shirt before the discount is $30, and the discount percentage is 40%. So, the amount that Davos paid for each shirt after the discount can be calculated as follows:\nAmount paid after discount = Original price x (1 - Discount percentage)\n= $30 x (1 - 0.4)\n= $30 x 0.6\n= $18\nTherefore, Davos paid $18 for each shirt after the discount.")

How many plant pots does April need for the roses?\nThe problem states that the local school needs twice as many plant pots for the roses as they need for the daisies. Since the daisies need 30 plant pots, the roses need 30 x 2 = 60 plant pots.\nSo, the answer is 60.\n4. How many plant pots does April have left over?\nWe know that April had 100 plant pots before she knew how many she needed, and she needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots for the daisies and roses.\nSo, the answer is 10 (100 - 90 = 10).\nTherefore, April has 10 plant pots left over after donating them to the local school.")

How many bugs did Nancy count total?\n\nNow, let's solve each sub-question step by step:\nSub-question 1: How many spiders did Nancy see?\nNancy saw 90 spiders.\n\nSub-question 2: How many millipedes did Nancy see?\nThe question states that Nancy saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. Since Nancy saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is 90 / 3 = 30.\nSo, Nancy saw 30 millipedes.\n\nSub-question 3: How many stink bugs did Nancy see?\nThe question states that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Since Nancy saw 30 millipedes, the number of stink bugs is 2 x 30 - 12 = 60.\nSo, Nancy saw 60 stink bugs.\n\nSub-question 4: How many bugs did Nancy count total?\nWe know that Nancy saw 90 spiders, 30 millipedes, and 60 stink bugs. Therefore, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 90 + 30 + 60 = 180 bugs.\nSo, Nancy counted 180 bugs in total.")

How many onions did Sophia buy at the market?\nWe know that Rose bought 12 onions, so Sophia must have bought fewer onions. Let's assume Sophia bought x onions.\n2. How many potatoes did Sophia buy at the market?\nWe know that Rose bought 4 potatoes, so Sophia must have bought fewer potatoes. Let's assume Sophia bought y potatoes.\n3. How many times did Rose buy more onions and potatoes than Sophia?\nWe know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. So, if Sophia bought x onions and y potatoes, Rose bought 4x onions and 4y potatoes.\nNow, let's connect these sub-questions to find the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought at the market:\nTotal onions = x (Rose bought 12 onions) + Sophia's onions (Sophia bought x onions)\nTotal potatoes = y (Rose bought 4 potatoes) + Sophia's potatoes (Sophia bought y potatoes)\nSo, Sophia bought a total of x + y onions and potatoes at the market.")

How many days are there between December 31st and Andy's birthday on July 19th?\nSolution: There are 180 days between December 31st and July 19th.\n2. How many calories does Andy need to burn each day to lose 30 lbs by his birthday?\nSolution: To lose 30 lbs, Andy needs to burn a total of 30 x 3500 = 105,000 calories. Since there are 180 days between December 31st and July 19th, Andy needs to burn an average of 105,000 / 180 = 580 calories per day.\n3. How much of a calorie deficit does Andy need to create each day to reach his goal?\nSolution: To create a calorie deficit of 580 calories per day, Andy needs to burn more calories than he consumes. So, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 580 - (calories consumed) = x calories per day.\nNow, let's find out how much calories Andy needs to consume each day to maintain his current weight.\n4. How many calories does Andy currently consume each day?\nSolution: We don't have the exact calorie intake of Andy, but we can estimate it based on his weight and activity level. Let's assume Andy's daily calorie intake is around 2500 calories, which is a reasonable estimate for an average adult male.\n5. How much of a")

Since he needs two implants, he needs to pay $2500 x 2 = $5000 for the dental work.\n2. How many hours does George need to work to save enough money for the dental work?\nGeorge makes $15 per hour at work, so he needs to work:\n$5000 / $15 per hour = 333 hours\nSo George needs to work 333 hours to save enough money for the dental work.\n3. How many hours does George need to work to pay for the dental work if he works every day?\nSince George works every day, he can work:\n333 hours / 7 days per week = 47 hours per week\nSo George needs to work 47 hours per week for 33 weeks to save enough money for the dental work.\n4. How many hours does George need to work to pay for the dental work if he works only 5 days per week?\nSince George works only 5 days per week, he can work:\n47 hours per week / 5 days per week = 9 hours per day\nSo George needs to work 9 hours per day for 33 weeks to save enough money for the dental work.\nTherefore,")

The problem states that the tow truck pulled four fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week. If it pulled 4 fewer cars on the fourth day, then it pulled 9 cars on that day (since it pulled 10 cars on the first three days). If it pulled 4 fewer cars on the fifth day, then it pulled 5 cars on that day (since it pulled 9 cars on the fourth day).\nSo, the tow truck pulled 30 + 9 + 5 = 44 cars on the first five days of the week.\nTherefore, the total number of cars towed by the tow truck that week is 44 x 7 = 308 cars.')

How many hours did James hire the carriage for?\nJames hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which means he hired it for 4 hours.\n\n2. What is the cost of the first hour of the carriage hire?\nAccording to the problem, the first hour of the carriage hire costs $15.\n\n3. How many hours did James get for free?\nSince James got 1 hour free, he got 1 hour without paying any cost.\n\n4. What is the total cost of the carriage hire to James?\nTo find the total cost of the carriage hire to James, we need to multiply the cost of each hour by the number of hours he hired the carriage.\nFor the first hour, the cost is $15, so the total cost of the first hour is $15.\nFor each subsequent hour, the cost is twice the cost of the previous hour, so the cost of the second hour is $30 (twice $15), the cost of the third hour is $60 (twice $30), and so on.\nTo find the total cost of the carriage hire to James, we need to add up all these costs:\n$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) + ... = total cost\n\nSo, the total cost of the carriage hire to James is:\n$15 + $30 + $60 + ... = $15 + $30 + $6")

If it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, then it took her x minutes to cook the beans. Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, we can write:\nx = (30/2) = 15 minutes\nSo, Finley cooked the beans in 15 minutes.\n2. Finley cooked the pork for y minutes, where y is the difference between the time it took her to cook the pork and the time it took her to cook the rice. Since it took her 20 minutes more to cook the pork than the rice, we can write:\ny = 20\nSo, Finley cooked the pork for 20 minutes.\n3. To find out how long Finley cooked all the food (rice, beans, and pork), we need to add the time she spent cooking each of them:\nTotal cooking time = 30 + 15 + 20 = 65 minutes\nSo, Finley cooked all the food for 65 minutes.\n4.

How many pounds of gravel can Gissela's truck carry?\nGissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel, so the answer is 4,000 pounds.\n2. How many pounds of gravel can Gordy's truck carry?\nGordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so if Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.\n3. How many pounds of gravel can the three trucks combined carry?\nWhen Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 4,000 + 4,800 + 4,800 = 13,600 pounds of gravel.\n4. How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?\nWe know that the three trucks combined can haul 13,600 pounds of gravel, and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. So, if Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds, Gary's truck can carry 13,600 - 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.")

How many matches did Joey play on Monday?\nThe question states that Joey played 2 matches on Monday. So, the answer is 2.\n2. How many matches did Joey play on Friday?\nThe question doesn't provide any information about Joey's matches on Friday. So, the answer is 0.\n3. How many matches did Joey play on Saturday?\nThe question states that on Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. If Joey played 2 matches on Monday, then he played 4 matches on Saturday (double 2).\n4. How many matches did Joey play in total in one week?\nTo find out how many matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the number of matches he played on each day: 2 + 0 + 4 = 6. So, Joey played 6 matches in one week.\nTherefore, the answer to the original question is 6.")

(756, " Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller sub-questions:\n1. How many votes were there in total?\n2. How many votes were in favor of the new regulation?\n3. How many votes were against the new regulation?\n\nNow, let's solve each sub-question:\n\n1. Total number of votes:\nWe are told that the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. Let's assume that the number of votes against the new regulation is x. Then, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x.\nSo, the total number of votes is 33 (the number of people on the council) + (2x) (the number of votes in favor of the new regulation).\n2. Number of votes in favor of the new regulation:\nWe know that the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. So, we can set up the following equation:\n2x = x + (33 - x)\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 16\nSo, there were 16 votes in favor of the new regulation.\n3. Number of votes against the new regulation:\nWe know that the number of votes against the new regulation is equal to the total number of votes minus the number of votes in favor of the new regulation. So, we can set up the following equation:\n33 - 16 = x\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 17\nSo, there were 17 votes against the new regulation.\nTherefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation was 16, and the number of votes against it was 17.")

How many cows does the farmer need to have to produce 25 liters of milk per day?\nWe want to find out how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 10 liters more (25 liters - 15 liters) of milk per day.\nSo, we need to find out how many cows we need to add to the 3 cows the farmer already has to produce 10 liters more milk per day.\nLet's divide 10 liters by the amount of milk produced by each cow per day (5 liters):\n10 liters / 5 liters/cow/day = 2 cows\nSo, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.")

How many books does Fawn have?\n\nNow, let's solve each sub-question step by step:\n\n1. How many books does Sofie have?\nThe problem states that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne. So, if Anne has x books, Sofie has x + 25 books.\n2. How many books does Anne have?\nWe know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Anne has x books.\n3. How many books does Fawn have?\nWe are told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. So, if Anne has x books, Fawn has x - 12 books.\nNow, let's find the value of x:\n1. Sofie has x + 25 books, Anne has x books, and Fawn has x - 12 books.\n2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie's books are x + 25 = x + (25 - 12) = x + 13 books.\n3. Anne has x books, and Fawn has x - 12 books. So, the total number of books among Sofie, Anne, and Fawn is: x + x - 12 = 85 books.\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 48 books\n\nTherefore, Sofie has 48 + 25 = 73 books, Anne has 48 books, and Fawn has 48 - 12 = 36 books.")

Since a box of jello is 3 ounces, Greg needs to buy 120 / 3 = 40 boxes of jello.\n2. How much will Greg spend on jello?\nSince jello is currently on sale for $1.25, Greg will spend $1.25 x 40 = $50 on jello.\n3. How many cups of jello will Greg have left over?\nGreg will have 40 boxes of jello, and each box makes 10 small jello cups, so he will have 40 x 10 = 400 small jello cups in total. Since he wants to have enough for each kid to have 4 cups, he will have 400 / 4 = 100 small jello cups left over.\nTherefore, Greg will spend $50 on jello and have 100 small jello cups left over.")

What is John's profit from renting out his car?\n\nLet's solve each sub-question step by step:\n\n1. How much revenue does John earn from renting out his car?\n\nJohn rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. So, the total number of hours John rents out his car in a month is:\n10 x 3 = 30 hours\nSince John gets paid $25 per hour, the total revenue he earns from renting out his car in a month is:\n30 hours x $25/hour = $750\n\n2. How much does it cost John to rent out his car?\n\nJohn's car payment is $500. So, the cost of renting out his car is:\n$500 (car payment) / 10 (times he rents out his car per month) = $50 per month\n\n3. What is John's profit from renting out his car?\n\nTo find John's profit, we need to subtract the cost of renting out his car from the revenue he earns:\n$750 (revenue) - $50 (cost) = $700\nSo, John makes a profit of $700 from renting out his car.\n\nTherefore, John makes a profit of $700 from renting out his car.")

How much do both cars cost together?\n\nLet's solve each sub-question step by step:\n\n1. What is the price of the red car?\nWe know that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. So, if the blue car costs $100, the red car costs:\n$100 x 0.60 = $60\nSo, the price of the red car is $60.\n\n2. What is the difference between the price of the red car and the price of the blue car?\nThe difference between the price of the red car and the price of the blue car is:\n$100 - $60 = $40\n\n3. If the price of the blue car is $100, what is the cost of the blue car?\nWe know that the blue car costs $100.\n\n4. How much do both cars cost together?\nThe cost of the red car is $60, and the cost of the blue car is $100.
