If the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, then we know that the total amount of blue fiber needed is 2 bolts.\nClue #2: The robe takes half as much white fiber as it takes blue fiber.\nHmm, that's interesting! If the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, then we can infer that the total amount of white fiber needed is also half of the total amount of blue fiber needed.\nSo, if the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, then the total amount of white fiber needed is:\nHalf of 2 bolts = 1 bolt\nGreat, we now know that the robe takes a total of 3 bolts of fiber: 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber.\nBut wait, there's more! We're not done yet. We still need to find out how much each bolt of fiber weighs. Let's assume that one bolt of blue fiber weighs the same as one bolt of white fiber.\nClue #3: The blue fiber weighs the same as the white fiber.\nAha! That helps us narrow down the calculation. If the blue fiber and white fiber weigh the same, then we can use the weight of one bolt of blue fiber to calculate the total weight of all the fiber used in the robe.\nSo, if one bolt of blue fiber weighs x amount, then the total weight of all the fiber used in the robe is:\nx + x = 2x\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n2x = 3\n\nx = 1.")

Since he stopped after 20 miles, he traveled 40 miles (60 - 20 = 40) more after his first stop.\nDistance after first stop = 40 miles\nStep 2: Now, let's find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops. We know he traveled 40 miles after his first stop, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Therefore, the distance between his first and second stops is:\nDistance between first and second stops = 40 miles - 15 miles = 25 miles\nSo, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.\nTherefore, the answer to the question is: Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops during his 60-mile bike trip.")

Since they cost $5 less than the boots, and the boots cost $X dollars, we can write:\n$X = $X + $5\nStep 2: Now, let's solve for the cost of the high heels. We know that one pair costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so the cost of the second pair is twice $33, or $66. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:\n$X + $33 + $66 = $100\nStep 3: Now that we know the cost of the high heels, we can find the cost of the boots. Since the boots cost $X dollars, and the high heels cost a total of $100 - $5 = $95, we can write:\n$X = $95 - $100\nStep 4: Now, let's solve for $X. We know that $X is the cost of the boots, so we can divide both sides of the equation by $100 to find:\n$X = $95 / $100 = $0.")

Since the number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, we can subtract 12 from the total number of pets to get the number of rabbits pets:\n180 pets - 12 = 168 pets (including 12 rabbits)\nAnd that's the final solution! The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 168, including 12 rabbits.")

Here are the clues we have:\nClue 1: Harry slept 9 hours.\nClue 2: James slept less than Harry.\nNow, let's use our detective skills to piece together the solution. If Harry slept 9 hours and James slept less than Harry, that means James slept for a shorter time than 9 hours.\nLet's assume James slept for x hours. Since James slept less than Harry, we know that x is less than 9.\nNow, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. To do this, we can subtract the amount James slept (x) from the amount Harry slept (9):\n9 - x = x + 9\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 6\nSo, James slept for 6 hours less than Harry. In other words, Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 more hours than James.\nTherefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.")

Let's assume these colors are labeled Crayon A, B, C, D, and E.\nClue #2: One crayon costs $2.\nAs you mentioned, one crayon costs $2. This means that the total cost of the 5 crayons Violetta needs is:\n$2 x 5 = $10\nNow, let's calculate the change Violetta will get:\nChange = Cost of crayons - Amount paid\n= $10 - $20\n= -$10\nOh no!

If a pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser combined, then the cost of a pencil and eraser must be $1.20 (the cost of a pen).\nSo, the cost of a pencil is $1.20, and the cost of an eraser is $0.30.\nStep 2: Now that we know the cost of a pencil and eraser, we can find the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of a pencil and eraser by 8.\n$1.20 (cost of a pencil) x 8 = $9.60\n$0.30 (cost of an eraser) x 8 = $2.40\nTotal cost of 8 pens = $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00\nTherefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00.\nGreat job, detective!

If Mike receives a letter from one of the 3 people, he will respond with a letter of his own.\nNow, let's calculate how many hours Mike spends writing a week:\nStep 1: Calculate the number of letters Mike receives in a week.\nSince Mike receives 2 letters from each of the 3 people he is still exchanging letters with, he will receive a total of 6 letters in a week.\nStep 2: Calculate the number of hours Mike spends writing each letter.\nSince Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, and each letter is 5 pages long, he will spend approximately 30 minutes writing each letter.\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of hours Mike spends writing in a week.\nNow, let's multiply the number of letters Mike receives in a week by the time it takes him to write each letter:\n6 letters / week x 30 minutes / letter = 180 minutes / week\nTherefore, Mike spends approximately 180 minutes (or 3")

Since the tree is 200 feet tall, we can calculate the total weight of the untouched wood as follows:\n200 feet x 10 feet/section = 2,000 sections of wood\n2,000 sections x 400 pounds/section = 800,000 pounds\nSo, the weight of the untouched wood is 800,000 pounds.\nStep 2: Calculate the weight of the wood eaten by termites\nUsing Clue 2, we know that termites ate 30% of the wood. So, the weight of the wood eaten by termites is:\n800,000 pounds x 30% = 240,000 pounds\nSo, the total weight of the redwood tree is:\n800,000 pounds (untouched wood) + 240,000 pounds (wood eaten by termites) = 1,040,000 pounds\nStep 3: Find the height of the redwood tree\nUsing the given height of the redwood tree (200 feet), we can calculate its weight:\n1,040,000 pounds / ")

We can write this as:\nRuby = 6 x Sam\n\nClue #2: In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.\nIn 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This means that Ruby will be 3 x Sam in 9 years. We can write this as:\nRuby = 3 x Sam + 9\n\nNow, let's combine these two clues:\nRuby = 6 x Sam + 9\n\nNow, we need to solve for Sam. To do this, we can subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:\nRuby = 6 x Sam - 9\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:\nSam = Ruby / 6\n\nNow, we can solve for Sam:\nSam = (Ruby / 6)\n\nSo, Sam is 6/7 of Ruby's age. In other words, Sam is 6/7 of Ruby's age away from being as old as Ruby.\nNow, we know that Ruby is 3 times as old as Sam, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\nRuby = 3 x Sam + 9\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\nRuby = 3 x (6/7) + 9\n\nNow, we can solve for Sam:\nSam = (Ruby / 3) x 7\n\nNow, we can solve for Sam:\nSam = (Ruby / 3) x 7\n\nSo, Sam is 49 years old.\n\nTherefore, Sam is 49 years old, and Ruby is 274 years old (6 x")

Subtracting the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting, physical violence, and refusing to wear masks, we can find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons:\n50 - 7 - 2")

Since the caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests, the caterer was asked to prepare 36 hot dogs.\nStep 2: Now, let's use Clue 2 to find out how many hot dogs the caterer actually prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs, the caterer prepared 36 / 2 = 18 hot dogs.\nStep 3: Now, let's use Clue 3 to find out how many guests wanted a second hot dog.

Here are the clues we have:\nClue 1: Benny saw a 10-foot shark.\nClue 2: The shark had 2 6-inch remoras attached to it.\nNow, let's use our detective skills to build up to the final solution step by step:\nStep 1: Convert the length of the shark from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so:\n10 feet x 12 inches/foot = 120 inches\nStep 2: Calculate the total length of the shark, including the remoras. We know the length of the shark is 10 feet, and each remora is 6 inches long. So, the total length of the shark and the remoras together is:\n10 feet + (2 x 6 inches) = 10 feet + 12 inches = 12 feet\nStep 3: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras make up. To do this, we need to divide the length of the remoras by the total length of the shark and remoras:\n(12 inches) / (12 feet + 12 inches) = 0.167 = 16.7%\nSo, the combined length of the remoras is 16.7% of the shark's body length.\nStep 4: Write the final solution.

Heather's razors come 4 to a pack.\n2. They cost $4.00 a pack.\n3. They are currently on sale for buy one get one free.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the Clues\nLet's analyze each clue separately and see if we can find any patterns or connections:\nClue 1: 4 razors per pack\nThis means that each individual razor costs $4.00 / 4 = $1.00 per razor.\nClue 2: They cost $4.00 a pack\nSo, if Heather buys 2 packs of razors, she will pay $4.00 x 2 = $8.00 in total.\nClue 3: They are currently on sale for buy one get one free\nThis means that Heather will get an additional pack of razors for free, which she can use to reduce the cost of the second pack.\n\nStep 3: Apply the Clues\nNow, let's apply the clues to find the cost of each individual razor after the discount:\nHeather will buy 2 packs of razors, so she will pay $8.00 in total.\nSince the second pack is free, Heather will actually pay $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00 for the second pack.\nSo, the cost of each individual razor after the discount is:\n$6.00 / 4 = $1.50 per razor.\n\nStep 4: Con")

Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64" tall, the bottom row will be 9 x 64 = 576 inches tall.\nStep 2: Now, let\'s use Clue 2 to find out how tall the top row is. Since the 10th cheerleader is 60" tall, the top row will be 10 x 60 = 600 inches tall.\nStep 3: Now that we know the height of the bottom and top rows, let\'s find out the height of the middle row. Since there are 3 cheerleaders standing on top of the bottom row, and each cheerleader is 64" tall, the middle row will be 3 x 64 = 192 inches tall.\nStep 4: Finally, let\'s find out the height of the human pyramid overall. Since the bottom row is 576 inches tall, the middle row is 192 inches tall, and the top row is 600 inches tall, the overall height of the human pyramid will be 576 + 192 + 600 = 1368 inches')

If Ray takes x minutes to swim 3 miles when the water is cold, and he takes y minutes to swim a mile when the water is warm, how long will it take him to swim 3 miles on a hot day?\nWe know that when the water is warm, Ray takes 2 minutes more than twice as long to swim a mile as when the water is cold. So, if he takes x minutes to swim 3 miles when the water is cold, he will take (2x + 2) minutes to swim 3 miles when the water is warm.\nNow, let's use the information we've gathered to solve the problem:\n5. We know that Ray takes 16 minutes to swim a mile when the water is cold, and he takes 20 minutes to swim a mile when the water is warm.

And if one-third of these remaining seats are occupied by the parents, then there are 72 / 3 = 24 seats occupied by the parents.\nClue #3: The rest of the seats were occupied by the students.\nSo, if the rest of the seats were occupied by the students, then there are 72 - 24 = 48 seats left. And if the students occupied all of these seats, then there are 48 x 18 = 864 students in the school auditorium.\nNow that we have gathered all the clues, let's put them together to solve the mystery. We know that one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, and the rest of the seats were occupied by the students. So, the total number of students in the school auditorium is:\n864 = 72 + 24 + 48\nGreat! We have solved the mystery. There are 864 students in the school auditor")

Let\'s call this number "1000".\nWe also know that one of the DVDs in the public library has been played 356 times, and the other has been played 135 times.\nStep 2: Analyze the Clues\nNow, let\'s think about what these numbers tell us. If we multiply the number of times the first DVD has been played (356) by 1000, we get 356,000. This is the number of times the first DVD can be played before it breaks.\nSimilarly, if we multiply the number of times the second DVD has been played (135) by 1000, we get 135,000. This is the number of times the second DVD can be played before it breaks.\nStep 3: Connect the Dots\nNow, we need to find out how many times both DVDs can be played before they break. To do this, we need to add the number of times each DVD can be played before it breaks. So, we add 356,000 and 135,000:\n356,000 + 135,000 = 491,000\nTherefore, both DVDs in the public library can be played a total of 491,000 times before they break.\nStep 4: Solve the Mystery\nAnd there you have it, folks!

So, to find out how far he travels each way, we can multiply the speed by the time he spends driving:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 75 mph x 1 hour = 75 miles\nNow we know that Jack travels 75 miles each way.\nStep 2: Find out how long Jack is gone from home.\nWe know that Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Since he drives 75 mph, he can cover 75 miles in 1 hour. So, to find out how long he is gone from home, we can divide the time he spends at the museum by the distance he travels each way:\nTime gone = Distance / Speed\nTime gone = 75 miles / 75 mph = 1 hour\nNow we know that Jack is gone from home for 1 hour.\nStep 3: Check our calculations.\nLet\'s double-check our calculations to make sure we\'re correct:\n* Distance traveled each way = 75 miles\n* Time spent at the museum = 6 hours\n* Time gone from home = 1 hour\nYes, our calculations look good!

Since it's 150% of her regular hourly rate, we can multiply her regular hourly rate by 1.5:\n$2.50/hour x 1.5 = $3.75 per hour\nStep 3: Calculate Jamie's total pay for last Tuesday.\nNow that we have Jamie's regular and special hourly rates, we can calculate her total pay for last Tuesday:\nTotal pay = Number of hours worked x Hourly rate\nIn this case, Jamie worked 11 hours last Tuesday, so her total pay is:\n$3.75/hour x 11 hours = $42.25\nTherefore, Jamie was paid $42.25 for her work last Tuesday.\nGreat job, detective!

Since $50,000 came from organizations, we know that the organizations contributed $50,000 / $175,000 = 29% of the total amount raised.\nStep 2: Now that we know the percentage of the total amount contributed by organizations, we can find out how much each student raised. Since the remaining $125,000 came from the students, and there are 20 students, we can calculate the amount each student raised as $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.\nStep 3: Finally, we can find out how much each student raised by dividing the amount they raised by the total amount raised by all 20 students: $6,250 / $175,000 = $35.71.\nSo, each student raised approximately $35.71 for the charity.

So, Chikote's howls last for 40 seconds each.\nClue #3: Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.\nNow, let's use these clues to find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls:\nTobias's howls + Chikote's howls + Igneous's howls = ?\nWe know that Tobias's howls last for 20 seconds, Chikote's howls last for 40 seconds, and Igneous's howls last for the combined length of the other two wolves. So, we can write the equation:\n20 + 40 + (Tobias's + Chikote's + Igneous's) = ?\nNow, let's solve for the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls:\n20 + 40 + (20 + 40 + x) = ?\nWhere x is the combined length of time of Tobias's, Chikote's, and Igneous's howls.\nSimplifying the equation:\n60 + 40 + x = ?\nSolving for x:\nx = 100\nSo, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 100 seconds")

(996, " Ah, a delightful mystery! Let's dive in and solve it like a detective. üé©\nClue #1: Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.\nSo, if the average age of the group is x, then Helene is 2x years old.\nClue #2: The total age of the children is 20 years.\nSo, we can set up the equation:\nx + (2x) + (4) + (3) = 20\nSimplifying the equation:\n3x + 6 = 20\nSolving for x:\nx = 14\nSo, Helene is 28 years old. ü§ù\nClue #3: Akbar is 3 years old.\nSo, we know that Akbar is younger than Helene by 3 years.\nClue #4: Alessandro is 4 years old.\nSo, we know that Alessandro is younger than Akbar by 1 year.\nNow, let's find the age of Wilfred:\nWilfred is the youngest of the group, so his age is the least among the four children.\nSince Alessandro is 4 years old, and Akbar is 3 years old, we know that Wilfred is younger than Alessandro by 1 year.\nSo, Wilfred is 3 years old. üéâ\nTherefore, the age of Wilfred is 3 years old. üòä\nMission accomplished! üéØ\nDid you enjoy solving this mystery with me? ü§î")

(998, " Great! Let's get started.\nClue #1: The number of guests at the wedding was 100.\nWe know that each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies brought to the wedding is:\n100 guests x 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies\nClue #2: The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you.\nIf the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, then the number of cookies she gave is equal to the total number of cookies divided by 2:\n1500 cookies √∑ 2 = 750 cookies\nClue #3: The church next door received 15 cookies per person.\nIf the church next door received 15 cookies per person, and there were x people in the church, then the total number of cookies received by the church is:\nx people x 15 cookies per person = 750 cookies\nClue #4: The number of people in the church next door is equal to the number of cookies received by the church divided by 15.\nWe can set up an equation using the clues we have gathered:\nx = 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person\nx = 50 people\nSo, there were 50 people in the church next door.")

(999, " Great! Let's start by identifying the clues we have:\nClue 1: The total area of the watermelon is 100%.\nClue 2: Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.\nNow, let's use our detective skills to build up to the final solution step by step:\nStep 1: Let's first calculate the area of each kid's slice. Since each kid gets a slice that is half as big as the total area of the watermelon, the area of each kid's slice is:\nArea of each kid's slice = Total area of watermelon / 4 (kids) = 100% / 4 = 25%\nStep 2: Now, let's calculate the area of each adult's slice. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the area of each adult's slice is:\nArea of each adult's slice = 2 x Area of each kid's slice = 2 x 25% = 50%\nStep 3: So far, we have found out that the total area of the watermelon is 100% and that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. Now, let's find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets:\nPercentage of watermelon each adult gets = Area of each adult's slice / Total area of watermelon = 50% / 100% = 50%\nTherefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon, and each kid gets 25% of the watermelon.")
