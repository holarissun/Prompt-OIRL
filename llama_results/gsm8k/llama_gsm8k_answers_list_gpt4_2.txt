John runs for 3 hours on the first day.\n4. John runs half as much on the other two days.\n\nNow, let's use each piece of information to calculate John's running speed:\n1. Total distance run per week = 60 miles\nTotal distance run per day = 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day\n2. Time taken to run 20 miles = 20 miles / 3 hours = 6.67 miles per hour (on the first day)\n3. Time taken to run half the distance on the other two days = 6.67 miles per hour x 2 = 13.34 miles per hour (on the other two days)\nSo, John's average running speed is:\nAverage running speed = (6.67 miles per hour + 13.34 miles per hour) / 2 = 9.34 miles per hour\nTherefore, John runs at an average speed of 9.34 miles per hour.")

This means that if she can walk at a rate of speed x miles per hour, she can run at a rate of speed 4x miles per hour.\n2. Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. This means that if she can run at a rate of speed x miles per hour, she can skip at a rate of speed 0.5x miles per hour.\n3. If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, we know that she can run at a rate of speed 4x miles per hour.\n4. If Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can use the formula:\nTime running = (1/3) \\* 6 hours\nTime walking = (2/3) \\* 6 hours\n5. We know that Dana can travel at a rate of speed 4x miles per hour when she runs, and at a rate of speed 0.5x miles per hour when she skips.\n6. To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we can multiply the rate at which she moves by the time she spends moving:\nTotal distance traveled = rate x time\nTotal distance traveled = (4x miles/hour) x (6 hours) = 24 miles\n\nSo, Dana can travel 24 miles in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.")

Number of students per class (Saturdays):\nJust like on weekdays, each class has 15 students. So, Judy teaches a total of 56 classes x 15 students per class = 840 students per week on Saturdays.\n6. Class fee (Saturdays):\nJudy charges the same $15 per student fee on Saturdays as she does on weekdays. So, she earns a total of 840 students x $15 per student = $12,600 per week from her Saturday classes.\n7. Total weekly income:\nAdding up Judy's income from her daily and Saturday classes, we get: $7,875 (daily classes) + $12,600 (Saturdays) = $20,475 per week.\nTherefore, Judy makes $20,475 per week from teaching 5 dance classes every day")

The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore.\n3. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet.\n4. The shore was 64 seconds away.\n\nNow, let's use each piece of information to calculate the total amount of water the boat took on by the time Julia reached shore:\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of water taken on per row\nWe know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So, to find out how much water the boat takes on in one row, we can divide the amount of water per 10 feet by 10:\n2 liters/10 feet ÷ 10 = 0.2 liters per foot\nNow, let's use this formula to calculate the amount of water taken on by Julia in her 64-second journey to shore:\n0.2 liters/foot x 64 feet = 12.8 liters\nStep 2: Calculate the total amount of water taken on\nNow that we know how much water the boat takes on per row, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on by Julia in her entire journey:\n12.8 liters + 12.8 liters = 25.6 liters\nTherefore, by the time Julia reached shore, her boat had taken on 25.6 liters of water.\nGreat, we've solved the puzzle!

We are also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, if Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo has 300 photographs, Brittany's phone can hold at most 50 x 300 = 15,000 photographs.\n3. Finally, we are told that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, we can find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo by dividing the number of photographs his phone can hold by the number of photographs in his photograph: 1800 / 300 = 6 ducks.\nTherefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.")

We know that there are 700 bees in the hive, and we\'ve already determined that there are 700 queens. So, there are 700 queen bees in the hive.\nNow, let\'s put all the pieces together to find the total number of bees in the hive:\n700 bees = 700 queens + 1400 worker bees + 1400 babies\nSo, there are 2800 worker bees and 700 queen bees in the hive, for a total of 3500 bees!')

(142, " Great, let's solve this puzzle! Here's how much money Jordan could earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead:\n1. First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends on video games per week. If he plays for 2 hours every day, that's a total of 14 hours per week (7 days x 2 hours/day).\n2. Next, let's calculate how much money Jordan earns from his part-time job. If he works 20 hours per week (not including the time he spends on video games), and he earns $10 per hour, then he earns a total of $200 per week ($10/hour x 20 hours/week).\n3. Now, let's subtract the amount of money Jordan earns from his part-time job from the total amount of time he spends on video games. We subtract 14 hours/week from 20 hours/week to get 6 hours/week (20 hours/week - 14 hours/week = 6 hours/week).\n4. Finally, let's multiply the number of hours Jordan spends on video games per week by the hourly wage he could earn from his part-time job. If he spends 6 hours/week on video games, and he could earn $10/hour from his part-time job, then he could earn a total of $60 per week ($10/hour x 6 hours/week).\nSo, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he could earn a total of $260 per week ($200 from his part-time job + $60 from video games).")

We know they spent $2 for each gallon of lemonade they made, so if they sold x gallons, they spent $2x on sugar.\n3. Now, we need to find out how much they made from selling lemonade. We know they made $25 in profit, so if they sold x gallons, they made $25x in total revenue.\n4. Finally, we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. We know they spent $3 for each gallon of lemonade they made, so if they sold x gallons, they spent $3x on lemons.\nNow, let's place each piece of the puzzle:\n1. They sold 20 glasses per gallon, so they sold x/20 glasses of lemonade (where x is the number of gallons they sold).\n2. They spent $2 for each gallon of lemonade they made, so they spent $2x on sugar (where x is the number of gallons they sold).\n3. They made $25 in profit, so they made $25x in total revenue (where x is the number of gallons they sold).\n4.

Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.\n\nNow, let\'s start placing the pieces of the puzzle:\n\nPiece 1: The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day. This means that the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3 x however many red chickens Jerry has = x eggs/day.\nPiece 2: The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. This means that the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5 x however many white chickens Jerry has = y eggs/day.\nPiece 3: Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. This means that the total number of eggs collected by Jerry is 42 eggs/day.\nPiece 4: Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This means that the number of white chickens Jerry has is 2 more than the number of red chickens he has. Let\'s call the number of red chickens "r" (since we know it\'s greater than 0). Then the number of white chickens Jerry has is "r + 2".\nNow, let\'s connect the dots:\n\nx + y = 42 (from Piece 3)\nr + (r + 2) = 2 (from Piece 4)\n2r + 2 = 42\n\nNow we have two equations and')

(246, " Great, let's break down the problem step by step:\n1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.\nSo, if the makeup artist works for 6 hours per day (which is the same as 42 hours per week), Jean pays:\n$250/hour x 42 hours/week = $10,500 per week\n2. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so Jean needs makeup services for a total of:\n5 weeks x 42 hours/week = 210 hours\n3. The makeup artist requires very expensive makeup for the movie, so Jean needs to pay for the cost of the makeup in addition to the makeup artist's fee. Let's assume the cost of the makeup is $100 per hour.\nSo, the total cost of the makeup for the 210 hours of makeup sessions is:\n$100/hour x 210 hours = $21,000\n4. After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. Let's calculate the discount amount:\nDiscount amount = $21,000 x 10% = $2,100\nSo, the final amount Jean pays is:\n$10,500 (weekly fee) + $21,000 (cost of makeup) - $2,100 (discount) = $30,400\nTherefore, Jean pays a total of $30,400 for the makeup services throughout the 5-week movie production.")

(445, " Great, let's solve this puzzle piece by piece!\n1. Michael has six $5 bills, so he has a total of $30.\n2. For every mile the horse runs, Michael eats 1/2 a bail of hay, which costs $3. So, if the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, Michael will eat 1/2 bail of hay.\n3. The distance the horse runs in 30 minutes is:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 32MPH x 30 minutes\nDistance = 1080 miles\n4. Therefore, Michael will eat 1/2 bail of hay for every 1080 miles the horse runs.\n5. Now, let's calculate the cost of the hay:\nCost = Number of miles x Cost per mile\nCost = 1080 miles x $3 per mile\nCost = $3240\n6. Michael has $30 in total, so he can afford to buy $3240 - $30 = $3210 worth of hay.\nTherefore, after buying the hay, Michael will have $30 - $3210 = -$3180 in change.\nSo, the change Michael has after buying the hay is -$3180.")

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. So, he swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than 32 minutes (2 x 16 minutes).\n3. To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we need to find the difference between the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day and the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day.\nLet's use the information from step 2:\nRay swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. So, he swims 3 miles in 2 minutes more than 4 times as long as when the water is cold.\nNow, let's substitute the values we know:\nRay swims 1 mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. So, he swims 3 miles in 48 minutes (16 minutes x 3).\nBut on a hot day, he swims 3 miles in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. So, he swims 3 miles in 48 minutes + 2 minutes = 50 minutes.\nTherefore, Ray takes 50 minutes to swim 3 miles on a hot day, which is 10 minutes longer than when the water is cold.")

Next, we need to find the angle between the pyramid and the sun. Since the sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house, we can find the angle between the pyramid and the sun after 10 hours.\nAngle between pyramid and sun after 10 hours = 5 degrees x 10 hours = 50 degrees\n3. Now, we need to find the angle between the sun and the ground. Since the sun is moving directly upward, the angle between the sun and the ground is simply the angle of elevation (or inclination) of the sun's path.\nAngle between sun and ground = angle of elevation of the sun's path = 90 degrees - angle between pyramid and ground = 90 degrees - 32 degrees = 58 degrees\nSo, after 10 hours, the angle from the ground to the sun will be 58 degrees.")

Similarly, she taps her left foot 2 x 200 = 400 times during the same time period.\n3. Helga's total tap count:\nNow, let's calculate the total number of times Helga taps both of her feet. Since she taps her right foot 600 times and her left foot 400 times, the total number of times she taps both feet is 600 + 400 = 1000 times.\nTherefore, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is 1000 times.")

Damage to his car: The pothole is going to cause $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it's not fixed.\n2. Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: The city council will fine Ron $120 if he fixes the pothole himself.\n3. Cost of asphalt: Each bucket of asphalt costs $25.\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:\nTotal cost of fixing pothole = Damage to car + Fine for unauthorized road maintenance + Cost of asphalt\nTotal cost of fixing pothole = $450 + $120 + 3 x $25\nTotal cost of fixing pothole = $695\nNow, let's compare this to the cost of not fixing the pothole:\nIf Ron doesn't fix the pothole, he will have to pay $450 for the damage to his car.\nSo, by fixing the pothole, Ron saves $695 - $450 = $245.\nTherefore, Ron saves $245 by fixing the pothole himself instead of waiting for the city council to fix it.")

So, her special hourly rate for those additional hours is $2.50 x 1.5 = $3.75 per hour.\n4. Total hours worked: Jamie worked a total of 11 hours last Tuesday, including her regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.\n5. Total pay: To calculate Jamie's total pay for last Tuesday, we need to multiply the total hours worked by her hourly rate. For her regular hours, that's $2.50 x 8 = $20. For her additional hours, that's $3.75 x 3 = $11.25. Adding these amounts together gives us Jamie's total pay for last Tuesday: $20 + $11.25 = $31.25.\nTherefore, Jamie was paid $31.25 for her work last Tuesday.")

Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok.\nSo, the total time Britany spends on makeup in a month is:\n15 minutes/day x 6 days/week x 4 weeks/month = 60 minutes/month\nNow, let's add up the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month:\n288 minutes/month + 8 hours/month + 60 minutes/month = 358 minutes/month\nTherefore, Britany spends approximately 358 minutes (or 5.6 hours) on TikTok in a month.")

Savings:\nIf Cameron decides to go with the option of adding 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark, he will save the following amount:\n1600 pesos (for the 24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (actual cost) = 250 pesos\nSo, Cameron will save 250 pesos by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark.")

Next, we need to calculate how much money Jessica has available for shoes each month. Since she sets aside $500 for shoes, and her monthly paycheck is $2,000, we can calculate this as follows:\n$2,000 (monthly paycheck) - $500 (monthly amount set aside for shoes) = $1,500 (monthly money available for shoes)\n3. Now, we need to calculate how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year using the money available for shoes each month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate this as follows:\n$1,500 (monthly money available for shoes) x 12 (months in a year) = $18,000 (total amount available for shoes in a year)\n4. Finally, we need to divide the total amount available for shoes in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to calculate how many pairs Jessica can buy in a year.
