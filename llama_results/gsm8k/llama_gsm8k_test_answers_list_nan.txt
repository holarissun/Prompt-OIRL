Therefore, the maximum distance Polly could stand from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone is:\n1200 - 1000 = 200 feet\nSo, Polly could stand 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.")

Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.\n\nFrom these clues, we can deduce the following:\nJordan carried x balls, Jason carried 2x balls, and Jeffrey carried 3x balls.\nWe know that the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls that Jordan carried, plus the number of balls that Jason carried, plus the number of balls that Jeffrey carried.\nSo, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:\nx + 2x + 3x = ?\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n6x = 60\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, the coach brought 10 bags of basketballs to practice.")
