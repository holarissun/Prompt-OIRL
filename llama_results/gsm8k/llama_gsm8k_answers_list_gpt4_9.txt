Karan has borrowed $3,650 for five months, which means she will have to pay not only the principal amount but also the interest accumulated over that period. The interest rate is 10%, which means the interest is $365 (10% of $3,650). So, Karan has to pay $3,650 + $365 = $4,015 per month."\nPhilosopher 2: "Ah, but that\'s not the whole story. The problem doesn\'t just involve the interest rate, it also involves the time period over which the loan is taken. Since Karan has to pay the same amount every month, the amount of interest she pays each month is proportional to the number of months she takes the loan. In this case, she takes the loan for five months, so the interest she pays each month is $365 / 5 = $72 per month."\nPhilosopher 3: "Now, hold on a minute. Both of you are making a crucial mistake. The problem isn\'t just about the interest rate or the time period, it\'s about the compounding of interest. Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, the interest is compounded every month. That means the interest she pays in the first month is not just $365, but also the interest that accumulated in the previous months. So, the total interest she pays in the first month is $365 + ($365 x (10% / 5)) = $365 + $72.8 = $437.80.

So, if she spends 25% of her monthly income on shoes, that\'s $2,000 / 0.25 = $8,000 per month.

Perhaps she buys shoes only when she needs them, or when she finds a particularly nice pair. So, let\'s assume she buys shoes irregularly, and the number of pairs she buys in a year is not fixed. In that case, we need to calculate the average number of pairs she buys per year, which is... (calculates) ...yes, it\'s around 6 pairs per year!"\nPhilosopher 1: "Ah, I see what you\'re saying.
