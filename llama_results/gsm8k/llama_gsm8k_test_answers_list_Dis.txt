Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.\nNow, let's calculate the amount Mark makes from each publisher:\nFor Publisher A:\nNumber of sentences edited = 1000\nPayment per sentence = 5 cents\nTotal payment from Publisher A = 5 cents x 1000 sentences = $50\nFor Publisher B:\nNumber of sentences edited = 1000\nPayment per sentence = 2 x $0.05 = $1\nTotal payment from Publisher B = $1 x 1000 sentences = $1000\nNow, let's add up the total amount Mark makes from both publishers:\nTotal amount made by Mark = $50 + $1000 = $1005\nTherefore, Mark makes a total of $1005 in a week.")

So, if Joey loses 2 pounds per week in 1 week, then Sandy will lose 2 pounds per week / 4 weeks = 0.5 pounds per week.

Now, we need to find out how much the flight ticket costs. The problem states that the flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit.

To find out how many days it will take him to save that amount, we can use the formula: number of days = amount to save / daily savings. In this case, the amount to save is $8, and the daily savings is $2. So, number of days = $8 / $2 = 4 days."\nExpert 2: "That\'s correct! If he saves $2 daily, it will take him 4 days to save the remaining amount of $8. But let\'s also consider the possibility that he might not save exactly $2 daily. Maybe he\'ll save $1.50 one day and $3 the next. To account for this, we can use a formula called \'compound interest\'. It takes into account the fact that the money he saves each day is earning interest on itself. So, the number of days it will take him to save the remaining amount will be: number of days = (amount to save / daily savings) / (1 + interest rate)^number of days. In this case, the interest rate is 0%, since he\'s not earning any interest on his savings.

Now, let's think about the funding. We know that every month after the initial 5 months took 50% more funding. So, if the initial funding was $100,000, the funding for the first 5 months would be $100,000. For the next month, the funding would be $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000. The next month, it would be $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.\nExpert 3: That's a good observation.
