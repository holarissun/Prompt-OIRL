(1116, " To solve this problem, we need to use a combination of mathematical concepts, including basic arithmetic, proportions, and word problems. Here's how we can approach the solution:\n1. Start with the given information:\nBen starts each day with $50, spends $15 every day, and saves the rest.\n2. Write down the equation for the total amount of money Ben has after each day:\nLet T be the total amount of money Ben has after x days.\nT = $50 + ($15 x x)\n3. Use the information provided in the problem to find the number of days that have elapsed:\nAfter a few days, Ben's mom doubled his total savings, which means she added $50 to his original savings. So, the total amount of money Ben has after a few days is:\nT = $50 + ($15 x x) + $50 = $50 + ($15 x x/2)\nThen, his dad gave him an additional $10, so the total amount of money Ben has after a few days is:\nT = $50 + ($15 x x/2) + $10 = $50 + ($15 x x/2) + $10\n4. Solve for x:\nWe can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by $15:\nx = (T / $15)\nx = (($500 / $15) + 1) = 33\n5. Find the number of days that have elapsed:\nSo, Ben has been saving money for 33 days.\nTherefore, the answer is:\nBen has been saving money for 33 days.")

The small gate is 3 feet wide, so it takes up a total of 3 feet x 225 feet = 675 feet of fencing. The larger gate is 10 feet wide, so it takes up a total of 10 feet x 125 feet = 1250 feet of fencing.\nSo, the total amount of fencing Bob will need to fence in his garden is:\nTotal fencing = Perimeter - Small gate = 450 feet - 675 feet = 275 feet\nTherefore, Bob will need 275 feet of fencing to fence in his garden, taking into account the two gates.')

(1880, ' To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the passage to find the speed at which Milo can run and the speed at which he can roll downhill on his skateboard.\nAccording to the passage, Milo can run at a speed of 6 miles per hour.\nAlso, the passage states that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard at twice the speed that he can run, which means he can roll downhill at a speed of 12 miles per hour (2 x 6 miles per hour).\nNow, the passage also states that Cory can drive his wheelchair at twice the speed that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard. Since Milo can roll downhill at 12 miles per hour, Cory can drive his wheelchair at a speed of 24 miles per hour (2 x 12 miles per hour).\nFinally, the passage states that Cory always drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour.\nSo, if Cory always drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour, and Milo can run at a speed of 6 miles per hour, we can find the speed at which Milo can run in two hours by multiplying his running speed by the number of hours he has to run:\nMiles run by Milo in two hours = Miles per hour x Number of hours\n= 6 miles per hour x 2 hours\n= 12 miles\nTherefore, Milo can run 12 miles in two hours.')

Since the filling material is 80% full of the bag, the volume of the filling material is:\nVf = 0.8V\nThe density of sand is ρs, and the density of the filling material is ρf = ρs × (1 + 0.4), where 0.4 is the percentage increase in weight due to the filling material.\nSo, the weight of the sandbag is:\nW = ρsV + ρfVf\n= (ρs + 0.4ρs)V\n= 1.4ρsV\nNow, we are given that the sandbag weighs 250 pounds, so we can set up the equation:\n1.4ρsV = 250\nTo solve for ρs, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.4:\nρs = 250 / 1.4\n= 176.4\nSo, the density of the sand is approximately 176.4 pounds per cubic foot.\nTherefore, the weight of the sandbag is:\nW = ρsV = 176.4V\nIf the bag is 80% full of the filling material, the weight of the filling material is:\nWf = 0.8V × ρf = 0.8V × (1.4ρs) = 1.12V × ρs\nSo, the total weight of the sandbag is:\nW = W + Wf = 176.4V + 1.12V × ρs = 177.5V × ρs\nTherefore,")

So, the speed at which the pilot fish moved away from Keanu is the speed at which it was moving when it left Keanu's location.\nWe can set up a equation to represent the situation:\nKeanu's speed = 20 miles/hour\nShark's speed = 40 miles/hour (original speed)\nPilot fish's speed = x miles/hour (increased speed)\nWhen the shark doubled its speed, the pilot fish also doubled its speed, so:\nPilot fish's speed = x/2 miles/hour (increased speed)\nNow, we can use the concept of relative speed to find the speed at which the pilot fish moved away from Keanu:\nRelative speed = Shark's speed - Keanu's speed\n= 40 miles/hour - 20 miles/hour\n= 20 miles/hour\nSo, the pilot fish was moving away from Keanu at a speed of 2")

Butter:\nBill turned 1/4 of the milk into butter, which is 4 gallons (since 1/4 x 16 gallons = 4 gallons). So, he has 4 gallons of butter.\nButter sells for $5/gallon, so Bill makes $5 x 4 gallons = $20 from the butter.\n2. Sour cream:\nBill turned 1/4 of the milk into sour cream, which is 4 gallons (since 1/4 x 16 gallons = 4 gallons). So, he has 4 gallons of sour cream.\nSour cream sells for $6/gallon, so Bill makes $6 x 4 gallons = $24 from the sour cream.\n3. Whole milk:\nBill kept the rest of the milk as whole milk, which is 8 gallons (since 16 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons). So, he has 8 gallons of whole milk.\nWhole milk sells for $3/gallon, so Bill makes $3 x 8 gallons = $24 from the whole milk.\nTotal income:\nBill makes $20 + $24 + $24 = $78 from the butter, sour cream, and whole milk he produced.\nTherefore, the answer is $78.')

So, we can write:\n4G + 2F = 4(G - 2) + 2(G - 2) - 2 = 4G + 2F\nNow, we can solve for F by subtracting 4G from both sides of the equation:\n2F = 4G - 8\nF = 2G - 8\nSo, there are 2G - 8 yellow candies in the box.\nSince there are 10 purple candies in the box, we can find the total number of rainbow nerds by adding the number of yellow and purple candies:\nTotal number of rainbow nerds = 10P + 2G - 8 = 10P + 2G - 8\nTherefore, there are 10 + 2(2G - 8) = 10 + 4G - 8 rainbow nerds in the box.")

(5603, " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of percentage increase and decrease.\nLet's break it down step by step:\n1. James supercharges his car, which increases its speed by 30%. If the car's original speed was 150 mph, then the new speed after supercharging is:\nNew speed = Original speed x (1 + 30%)\nNew speed = 150 x 1.3 = 195 mph\n2. Then, James cuts weight by 15%. This reduces the weight of the car, which in turn increases its speed. The percentage increase in speed after cutting weight is:\nIncrease in speed = (New speed - Original speed) / Original speed x 100\nIncrease in speed = (195 - 150) / 150 x 100 = 33%\n3. Finally, we multiply the increase in speed by the original speed to find the new speed:\nNew speed = Original speed x Increase in speed\nNew speed = 150 x 33 = 495 mph\nTherefore, the new speed of James' car after supercharging and cutting weight is 495 mph.")
