So, we can write an equation:\n48 - 31 = ?\n\nNow, let's break it down into smaller pieces:\n\n* 48 - 31 = 17 (people who got off at the first stop)\n\nSo, 17 people got off the train at the first stop.\n\nNow, let's add this piece to our equation:\n\n48 - 31 = 17 + ? (people who got off at subsequent stops)\n\nWe don't know how many people got off at subsequent stops, but we can continue to break it down:\n\n* 17 + ? = 31 (people who got off at the second stop)\n\nSo, 31 people got off the train at the second stop.\n\nNow, let's continue this process:\n\n* 31 + ? = 48 (people who got off at the third stop)\n\nWe can keep adding pieces to our equation until we have the final answer:\n\n* 48 - 31 = 17 + 31 + ? (people who got off at subsequent stops)\n\nThe puzzle is asking us to find the value of ?, which is the number of people who got off the train at all the stops after the first stop.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n? = 25 (people who got off at all the stops after the first stop)\n\nTherefore, 25 people got off the train at all the stops after the first stop.")

Now, we know that Debby drank 109 bottles per day for 35 days. So, we can multiply the number of days she drank water bottles by the number of bottles she drank per day to find out how many bottles she drank in total:\n35 days x 109 bottles/day = 3625 bottles\n3. Finally, we are told that the bottles lasted for 74 days. So, we can subtract the number of days the bottles lasted from the number of bottles Debby drank in total to find out how many bottles Debby bought:\n3625 bottles - 74 days = 3551 bottles\n\nTherefore, Debby bought 3551 water bottles.")

We know that the total points scored by her team is 75.0, so we can calculate the number of points scored by everyone else on the team:\n6.0 points x number of players = 45.0 points\nSince Bianca scored 45.0 points, that means she scored 45.0 / 2 = 22.5 points.\nNow, let's use the information that everyone else on the team scored 6.0 points each. We know that the total points scored by everyone else is 45.0 points, so we can calculate the number of players on the team:\n45.0 points / 6.0 points per player = 7.5 players\nTherefore, Bianca's team had 7.5 players.")

Henry needs 8.0 action figures in total, so he needs 8 - 3 = 5 more action figures.\nLet's place the next piece:\n3. Each action figure costs $6.0, so the cost of the next 5 action figures is $6.0 x 5 = $30.0.\nNow, let's add the next piece:\n4. Henry already has $18.0, so the total amount of money he needs to finish his collection is $18.0 + $30.0 = $48.0.\nAnd finally, let's place the last piece:\n5. Henry needs 8 action figures in total, so he needs $48.0 / 8 = $6.0 per action figure.\nTherefore, Henry needs a total of $6.0 x 8 = $48.0 to finish his collection of action figures.")

This summer, Maura found 75 seashells. She gave some to her little sister, and then Maura had 57 seashells left.\nTo find out how many seashells Maura gave to her sister, we can use the information that Maura had 57 seashells left after giving some to her sister. If Maura gave some seashells to her sister, then the number of seashells Maura had left must be less than 57.\nLet's start by using the information that Maura found 75 seashells this summer. We can assume that Maura found all of these seashells during the 21 days that her family stayed at the beach house. So, Maura found an average of 3.5 seashells per day (75 / 21 = 3.5).\nNow, let's assume that Maura gave some of these seashells to her sister. We know that Maura gave some seashells to her sister, but we don't know how many. Let's assume that Maura gave half of the seashells she found (3.5 / 2 = 1.75).\nSo, Maura had 57 seashells left after giving some to her sister. But, we also know that Maura found 75 seashells this summer, so we can add 1.75 (the number of seashells Maura gave to her sister) to 75 (the number of seashells Maura found) to find out how many seashells Maura collected in total:\n75 + 1.75 = 76.75")

Here's how we can break it down:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the circumference of the lake\nThe circumference of a circle is given by the formula: Circumference = 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the lake is 2 miles, the radius is half that value: radius = 2 miles / 2 = 1 mile.\nSo, the circumference of the lake is: Circumference = 2π(1 mile) = 6.28 miles.\nStep 2: Calculate the distance Chad travels when walking around the lake\nTo find the distance Chad travels when walking around the lake, we need to multiply the circumference by the number of times he walks around the lake: Distance = Circumference x Number of times around.\nSince Chad must either walk around the lake or canoe across it, he will walk around the lake once. So, the distance he travels when walking around the lake is:\nDistance = 6.28 miles x 1 = 6.28 miles.\nStep 3: Calculate the distance Chad travels when canoeing across the lake\nTo find the distance Chad travels when canoeing across the lake, we need to use the formula for the distance traveled by a point on a circular path: Distance = θr, where θ is the angle traveled and r is the radius of the circle.\nSince Chad must canoe across the lake, he will travel in a straight line across the lake, so the angle he travels is 90 degrees (or π/2 radians). The radius of the lake is the same as the diameter, so:\nDistance = πr = 3.14 miles.\nStep 4: Compare the distances traveled")

To do this, we can divide the total number of seats in each section by the number of rows in each section:\n30 seats per section / number of rows in each section = number of seats in each row\n\nSince there are 9 sections in total, and each section has 30 seats, the number of rows in each section is:\n9 sections x 30 seats per section = 270 seats\n\nSo, there are 270 seats in each row in the movie theater.\n\nNow, let's put all the pieces together to find the total number of seats in each section:\n270 seats in each row x number of rows in each section = total number of seats in each section\n\n270 seats in each row x 9 sections = 2430 seats\n\nTherefore, there are 2430 seats in each section in the movie theater.\n\nGreat, we've solved the puzzle!")

So, the number of lawns he actually mowed is 12 - 8 = 4.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Adam actually earned:\nAdam earned $9 for each lawn he mowed, so he earned $9 x 4 = $36 for the lawns he actually mowed.\n\nTherefore, Adam actually earned $108 - $36 = $72.\n\nGreat, we have solved the puzzle!")

(4689, " Great, let's solve this puzzle together! 🍎👨\u200d🎨\n\nTo find out how many apples each student gets, we need to divide the total number of apples (1720) by the total number of students (43).\nSo, the first piece of the puzzle is: 1720 apples ÷ 43 students = 40 apples per student.\nNow, we know that each student gets 40 apples. How many Skittles do they get? Let's use the information that each student has 9 Skittles.\nSo, the second piece of the puzzle is: 40 apples per student x 9 Skittles per student = 360 Skittles total.\nGreat, we have two pieces of the puzzle so far:\n\nPiece 1: 1720 apples ÷ 43 students = 40 apples per student\nPiece 2: 40 apples per student x 9 Skittles per student = 360 Skittles total\nNow, let's put the two pieces together to find the final answer:\n40 apples per student + 360 Skittles = ?\nCan you fill in the blank? 🤔")
