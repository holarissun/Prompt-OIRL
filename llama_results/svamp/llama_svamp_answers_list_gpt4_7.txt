(0, " Great, let's break it down step by step!\nступил 1: Let's first find the total number of pieces of candy in the jar. We know that there were 3409 pieces of candy in the jar.\nStep 2: Now, let's find out how many pieces of candy are red. We know that 145 pieces are red, which is a fraction of the total number of pieces. To find the fraction, we can divide the number of red pieces by the total number of pieces:\n145/3409 = 0.042\nSo, there are 420 pieces of candy that are not red (3409 - 145 = 3264).\nStep 3: Now, let's find out how many pieces of candy are blue. Since we know that the rest of the pieces are not red, we can conclude that they are blue. Therefore, the number of blue pieces is equal to the total number of pieces minus the number of red pieces:\n3264 - 145 = 3019\nSo, there are 3019 pieces of candy that are blue.")

(95, " Great, let's break down the problem step by step:\nɵ\n### Layers of the Problem:\n\n1. **Room Occupancy:** Each large room can accommodate 3 people, and each small room can accommodate 2 people.\n2. **Room Availability:** The hotel has a total of 26 people in the tourist group.\n3. **Room Rental:** The goal is to rent the least number of rooms possible to accommodate all 26 people while ensuring that every room is fully occupied.\n\n### Solution Layers:\n\n1. **Large Room Rental:** To maximize the efficiency of room rental, we should rent as many large rooms as possible. Let's assume we rent x large rooms.\n2. **Small Room Rental:** Since we have already rented x large rooms, we have x + 6 (small rooms) available. Let's assume we rent y small rooms, where y ≤ 6 (since we have 6 small rooms available).\n3. **Room Occupancy:** Now, let's calculate the occupancy rate for each room type:\n* Large rooms: 3x/26 ≈ 0.115 (occupied)\n* Small rooms: 6y/26 ≈ 0.238 (occupied)\n\n### Optimal Solution:\n\nBased on the calculations above, the optimal solution is to rent 4 large rooms (x = 4) and 2 small rooms (y = 2). This way, we can accommodate all 26 people with the least number of rooms possible:\n* Large rooms: 4 x 3 = 12 occupied\n* Small rooms: 2 x 2 = 4 occupied\n\nSo, the total number of rooms rented is 12 + 4 = 16.\n")

(we don't know yet)\n\nLayer 2: Now, the problem states that Adam ran 35 miles. So, the total distance Adam ran last week is:\nAdam's distance = 35 miles\n\nLayer 3: Since Adam ran more than Katie, we can set up the following equation:\nAdam's distance = Katie's distance + 25 miles\nSubstituting Adam's distance from Layer 2 into the equation above, we get:\nKatie's distance = Adam's distance - 25 miles\nNow we have two equations:\nKatie's distance = ... (from Layer 1)\nKatie's distance = Adam's distance - 25 miles (from Layer 3)\n\nLayer 4: Let's solve the system of equations. We can solve for Katie's distance by adding Adam's distance to both sides of the second equation:\nKatie's distance = Adam's distance - 25 miles + Adam's distance\nSimplifying, we get:\nKatie's distance = Adam's distance + 25 miles\n\nLayer 5: Now we have the solution to the problem. Katie ran a total distance of:\nKatie's distance = 35 miles + 25 miles = 60 miles\n\nSo, Katie ran a total of 60 miles last week.\n\nAnd that's how we solved the problem step by step!")

(588, " To calculate the total minutes spent on YouTube, we need to consider the average view duration and ad time separately.\nAverage view duration:\nAccording to the report, the average YouTube viewer watches 2 videos per day, and each video lasts 7 minutes. Therefore, the total view duration per day is:\n2 videos/day x 7 minutes/video = 14 minutes/day\nNow, let's consider the ad time:\nAccording to the report, viewers also watch 3 minutes of ads per day. Therefore, the total time spent on YouTube per day is:\n14 minutes/day (view duration) + 3 minutes/day (ad time) = 17 minutes/day\nSo, people spend approximately 17 minutes per day on YouTube.\nTo calculate the total minutes spent on YouTube over a period of time, we can simply multiply the daily time spent on YouTube by the number of days in the period:\nFor example, if we want to calculate the total minutes spent on YouTube over a month, we can multiply 17 minutes/day by 30 days in a month:\n17 minutes/day x 30 days/month = 510 minutes/month\nSimilarly, if we want to calculate the total minutes spent on YouTube over a year, we can multiply 510 minutes/month by 12 months in a year:\n510 minutes/month x 12 months/year = 6,120 minutes/year\nTherefore, according to the report, people spend approximately 6,120 minutes (or 102 hours) per year on YouTube.")

Now, each book cost him the same amount of money, i.e., $16. Therefore, the number of books Edward bought is equal to the amount of money he had before he spent it:\n$$ \\text{Number of books} = \\frac{\\text{Initial amount of money}}{{\\text{Cost of each book}}} $$\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n$$ \\text{Number of books} = \\frac{x}{16} $$\n4. Since Edward has $6 left after buying the books, we can set up the equation:\n$$ 6 = \\frac{x}{16} $$\n5.

Let's convert the amount of sugar from cups to a common unit, such as grams or pounds, to make the calculation easier:\n1 cup of sugar = 200 grams\nSo, Mary needs 7 cups of sugar (7 x 200 grams = 1400 grams).\n3. Now, let's find out how many cups of flour Mary put in:\nGiven: Mary needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar.\n4. If Mary needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, and she needs 7 cups of sugar, then she must have put in:\n7 cups of sugar - 2 cups of flour = 5 cups of flour\nSo, Mary put in 5 cups of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is 5 cups of flour.")

Let's call it x cups.\nNow, we need to find out how many cups of flour Mary still needs to add to the recipe. To do this, we can subtract the number of cups of flour she already used (x) from the total number of cups of flour needed (12):\n12 cups - x cups = 2 cups\nSo, Mary still needs to add 2 cups of flour to the recipe.")

The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar, and Mary has already added 62 cups. To find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required by the recipe:\n5 cups - 62 cups = -57 cups\nSince Mary has already added more sugar than the recipe requires, she doesn't need to add any more.\nSo, to summarize:\n* Mary needs to add 6 more cups of flour to the recipe.\n* Mary does not need to add any more cups of sugar to the recipe.\nGreat job!

Next, let's find out how much money the Razorback Shop made from selling jerseys during the game. We know that the shop makes $34 dollars off each jersey, so if they sold 19 jerseys, they made a total of:\n19 jerseys x $34 dollars/jersey = $642 dollars\n3. Now, let's find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey. We know that the Razorback Shop made more money from selling t-shirts than jerseys, so if the shop made $29,434 dollars from selling t-shirts and $642 dollars from selling jerseys, the difference between the two is:\n$29,434 dollars - $642 dollars = $28,792 dollars\nTherefore, a t-shirt costs $28,792 dollars / 157 t-shirts = $184.77 dollars more than a jersey.\nSo, a t-shirt costs $1")

(1793, " Great! Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find the total amount of silk that the factory was asked to dye for the order. The problem states that the factory dyed 61921.0 yards of silk green and 49500.0 yards pink. To find the total amount of silk, we need to add these two numbers together:\nTotal amount of silk = 61921.0 + 49500.0 = 111421.0 yards\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how much of each color the factory dyed. The problem states that the factory dyed 61921.0 yards of silk green and 49500.0 yards pink. To find out how much of each color the factory dyed, we can divide the amount of each color by the total amount of silk:\nGreen = 61921.0 / 111421.0 = 0.057 yards of green per yard of silk\nPink = 49500.0 / 111421.0 = 0.044 yards of pink per yard of silk\n\n3. Finally, we can use these values to find out how many yards of silk the factory dyed for the order. We know that the factory dyed 111421.0 yards of silk in total, and we know that it dyed 0.057 yards of green per yard of silk and 0.044 yards of pink per yard of silk. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of yards of silk dyed for the order as follows:\nTotal number of yards of silk dyed = 111421.0 x 0.057 (green) + 111421")

How many cases of Trefoils does Jenny need to deliver?\nNow, we know that Jenny needs to deliver 192.0 cases of Trefoils.\n4. How many extra boxes of Trefoils does Jenny have?\nLet\'s assume that Jenny has some extra boxes of Trefoils that she wants to deliver. Let\'s call this number "x".\n5. How many cases of Trefoils does Jenny need to deliver in total?\nWe know that Jenny needs to deliver 192.0 cases of Trefoils, and she has some extra boxes that she wants to deliver (x). So, the total number of cases of Trefoils that Jenny needs to deliver is:\n192.0 cases + x cases = Total number of cases\n6. Can you solve for the value of "x"?\nNow, we need to solve for the value of "x" in the equation:\n192.0 cases + x cases = Total number of cases\nx = Total number of cases - 192.0 cases\nx = -192.0 cases\nSo, Jenny has 192.0 cases of Trefoils that she wants to deliver, and she has some extra boxes that she wants to deliver (192.0 cases).\nTherefore, the answer is:\nJenny needs to deliver 192.0 cases of Trefoils')

Determine the amount of chocolate chips required per recipe:\nThe recipe calls for 2.0 cups of chocolate chips.\n2. Calculate the total amount of chocolate chips needed for all 23 recipes:\nTo find the total amount of chocolate chips needed, we multiply the amount per recipe by the number of recipes:\n2.0 cups per recipe x 23 recipes = 46.0 cups of chocolate chips needed in total\n3. Convert the total amount of chocolate chips needed from cups to a more manageable unit:\nSince we are dealing with large quantities of chocolate chips, it's more convenient to convert the amount to a smaller unit, such as ounces. There are 8 ounces in a cup, so:\n46.0 cups x 8 ounces/cup = 352.0 ounces of chocolate chips needed in total\n4. Determine the number of bags of chocolate chips needed to supply the demand:\nTo make it easier to handle and store the chocolate chips, we can divide the total amount needed into smaller quantities, such as bags. A standard bag of chocolate chips typically contains 10-12 ounces of chocolate chips.\nSo, to determine the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of chocolate chips needed by the amount in each bag:\n352.0 ounces / 10-12 ounces per bag = 30-36 bags of chocolate chips needed in total\nTherefore, to make ")

Let's represent this as 2g, where g is the number of games.\nSo, the total number of games Tom owned before purchasing the new ones is:\n2g + 2 = 4g\n\nStep 3: Find out how much Tom spent on video games:\nNow that we have the total cost of the games Tom purchased and the number of games he already owned, we can find out how much Tom spent on video games:\nTotal cost of games = Number of games x Cost per game\n$18.66 = 4g x $13.60\n$18.66 / $13.60 = 4g\n\nSo, Tom spent $18.66 on video games.\n\nArchitecture analogy:\n\nImagine you are an architect designing a building. You have the total cost of the materials you need to build the building ($18.66) and the number of floors you want to build (4g). You need to find out how much each floor will cost you. In this case, each floor represents one game, and the cost of each floor is the total cost of the game ($13.60). So, the cost of the first floor is $13.60, the cost of the second floor is $13.60 x 2 = $27.20, and so on. By using the formula, you can find out how much each floor will cost you and")

Since each crown has 7.0 different colored feathers, we can assume that each crown has 7 feathers in total.\nSo, to make 934 crowns, we need:\n934 crowns x 7 feathers per crown = 6,598 feathers\n2. Now, let's find out how many different colored feathers are needed. Since each feather is a different color, we can assume that each feather is a unique color.\nSo, to make 7.0 different colored feathers for each crown, we need:\n7.0 different colored feathers x 6,598 feathers = 46,766 feathers\n3. Finally, we need to find out how many crowns are needed to use all 46,766 feathers. Since each crown uses 7 feathers, we can calculate the number of crowns needed by dividing the total number of feathers by the number of feathers per crown:\n46,766 feathers ÷ 7 feathers per crown = 6,598 crowns\nSo, to make 934 crowns with dancing animals wearing crowns, we need:\n6,598 crowns x 7 feathers per crown = 46,766 feathers\nGreat!

His first destination is the famous Sky Falls, which is one of the tallest waterfalls in his country. It is said to be 20 times as tall as the tallest building in their city. If the building is 9 feet tall, how tall is Sky Falls?\nTo solve this problem, we can use the information given in the problem to create a layer-by-layer design. Here are the layers we need to consider:\nLayer 1: Height of the tallest building in the city\nWe are given that the building is 9 feet tall, which means it has a height of 9 feet = 108 inches.\nLayer 2: Ratio of Sky Falls to the tallest building\nWe are also given that Sky Falls is 20 times as tall as the tallest building in the city. This means that if the building is 108 inches tall, Sky Falls is 20 x 108 = 2160 inches tall.\nLayer 3: Conversion to feet\nSince inches are a unit of length, we can convert the height of Sky Falls from inches to feet by dividing it by 12, since there are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, the height of Sky Falls in feet is 2160 / 12 = 179.2 feet.\nTherefore, Sky Falls is 179.2 feet tall.")

How many strawberries did Adam eat?\n\nWe know that Adam picked 35 strawberries, and after eating some, he had 33 left. This means that Adam ate some strawberries, but we don\'t know how many.\n\nLet\'s call the number of strawberries Adam ate "x".\n\nWe know that x is greater than 0, because Adam did eat some strawberries.\n\nNow, let\'s use the information given in the problem to find the value of "x":\n\nWe know that Adam picked 35 strawberries, so the total number of strawberries Adam had was 35 + x.\n\nAfter eating some, Adam had 33 strawberries left, so the total number of strawberries Adam ate is 35 + x - 33.\n\nNow, we can use the equation 35 + x - 33 = x to solve for "x":\n\nx = 33\n\nSo, Adam ate 33 strawberries.\n\nGreat!

(4674, ' Great, let\'s dive into this problem!\n Commitment: 820 blocks in Bridget\'s block collection.\nStep 1: Divide the total number of blocks into groups.\nWe want to divide the 820 blocks into groups, so we can find out how big each group is. Let\'s start by dividing the total number of blocks by the number of groups we want to create:\n820 blocks / 82 groups = 10 blocks per group\nSo, each group contains 10 blocks.\nStep 2: Find the size of each group.\nNow that we know how many blocks are in each group, let\'s find the size of each group in terms of area. To do this, we need to find the length and width of each group.\nLet\'s assume the blocks are rectangular in shape, and the length and width of each block are equal (we\'ll call this length "L").\nThe area of each group can be calculated as:\nArea of each group = Length x Width\nSince there are 10 blocks in each group, the total area of each group is:\nTotal area of each group = 10 x L x W\nwhere L and W are the length and width of each block, respectively.\nStep 3: Calculate the total area of all the groups.\nNow that we know the size of each group, we can calculate the total area of all the groups. To do this, we simply multiply the total number of groups by the area of each group:\nTotal area of all groups = Number of groups x Area of each group\nSubstituting the values we have obtained so far:\nTotal area of all groups = 82 x (10 x L x W)\nwhere L and W are the length and width of each block, respectively.\nStep 4: Express the answer in a meaningful way.\nNow that we have the total area of all the groups, let\'s express it in a way that makes sense for our problem.
