Each ticket cost $9.00.\n\nNow, let's use these pieces of information to find out how much money Adam spent riding the Ferris wheel:\nTotal number of tickets Adam bought = 13.0\nNumber of tickets Adam had left after riding the Ferris wheel = 4.0\nCost of each ticket = $9.00\n\nTo find out how much money Adam spent riding the Ferris wheel, we can multiply the total number of tickets he bought by the cost of each ticket:\nTotal cost of riding the Ferris wheel = Total number of tickets x Cost of each ticket\n= 13.0 x $9.00\n= $108.00\n\nTherefore, Adam spent $108.00 riding the Ferris wheel.")
