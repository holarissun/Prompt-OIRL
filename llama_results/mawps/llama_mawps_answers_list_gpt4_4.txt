It tells us that Jose traveled a certain distance, which we can use to calculate his speed.\nClue #3: It took Jose 12.0 hours to get to Jane\'s house.\nWhat does this tell us? It tells us that Jose traveled at a constant rate for 12 hours. We can use this information to calculate his speed.\nNow, let\'s use the information we\'ve gathered to find out how fast Jose went:\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nIn this case, the distance is 24.0 miles, and the time is 12.0 hours. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nSpeed = 24.0 miles / 12.0 hours = 2 miles per hour\nSo, Jose went at a speed of 2 miles per hour.\nGreat! Now we have the solution to the mystery. Jose went at a speed of 2 miles per hour.')

Let's begin by gathering the clues:\nClue #1: The pet shelter had 17.0 puppies when another 55.0 were brought in.\nClue #2: 8.0 puppies are adopted each day.\nNow, let's build up to the final solution step by step:\nStep 1: Let's start by using the information from Clue #1 to find out the total number of puppies in the shelter now. We can do this by adding the initial 17.0 puppies to the number brought in:\nTotal number of puppies in the shelter = 17.0 + 55.0 = 72.0\nGreat, now we know the total number of puppies in the shelter.\nStep 2: Now, let's use the information from Clue #2 to find out how many days it will take to adopt all the puppies. We can do this by dividing the total number of puppies by the number adopted each day:\nNumber of days it will take to adopt all the puppies = Total number of puppies / Number adopted each day\nNumber of days it will take to adopt all the puppies = 72.0 / 8.0 = 9.0 days\nAh, the mystery is solved! It will take 9.0 days for all the puppies in the shelter to be adopted.\nBut wait, there's more! Let's double-check our calculation by using a different method. Let's divide the total number of puppies by the number of days left until all the puppies are adopted:\nNumber of days left until all the puppies are adopted = Total number of puppies / Number of days left to adopt all the puppies\nNumber of days left until all the puppies are adopted = 72.0 /")

We know the total number of members on the team was 11.0, and 6.0 of them didn't show up. That means the number of members who did show up is 11.0 - 6.0 = 5.0.\nNext, we need to find out how many points each member who did show up scored. We're told that each member who did show up scored 9.0 points. So, the total number of points scored by the 5.0 members who did show up is 5.0 x 9.0 = 45.0 points.\nFinally, we add the total number of points scored by the members who did show up to the total number of points scored by the members who didn't show up to find the total number of points scored by the team: 45.0 + (11.0 - 6.0) x 9.0 = 45.0 + 2.0 x 9.0 = 45.0 + 18.0 = 63.0 points.\nTherefore, the trivia team scored a total of 63.0 points in the game.")

So if the consumer reduced his oil consumption by the same percentage as the price increase, then we can calculate the percentage change in his petroleum bill by subtracting the percentage reduction from the percentage increase," we exclaim.\nClue #3: The percentage increase in the price of petroleum oil is 10.0%.\n"Great, let\'s use that information to calculate the percentage change in the consumer\'s petroleum bill," we continue.\nPercentage increase in petroleum bill = Percentage price increase x Original petroleum bill\n= 10.0% x ?\nWhere ? represents the original petroleum bill of the consumer.\nClue #4: The consumer\'s original petroleum bill is unknown.\n"Okay, so we need to find out the original petroleum bill of the consumer to solve the mystery," we say.

Let's gather the clues and piece together the solution.\nClue #1: The waiter had 22.0 customers in his section.\nClue #2: 14.0 of them left.\nClue #3: The rest of his tables had 4.0 people at each table.\nNow, let's use our detective skills to build up to the final solution step by step:\nStep 1: Let's calculate the total number of customers the waiter had before 14 of them left.\n22.0 customers x 14.0 customers = 30.0 customers\nSo, the waiter had 30 customers before 14 of them left.\nStep 2: Now, let's calculate the number of tables the waiter had based on the remaining customers.\nIf 4.0 people are at each table, and there are 30.0 customers remaining, then there are 30.0 / 4.0 = 7.5 tables.\nSo, the waiter had 7.5 tables.\nStep 3: Finally, let's confirm our answer by using the initial information given in the problem.\nThe problem states that the waiter had 22.0 customers in his section, and 14.0 of them left. This means that the number of customers in the section before 14 of them left was:\n22.0 customers - 14.0 customers = 8.0 customers\nSo, the waiter had 8.0 customers in his section before 14 of them left. And, based on the calculation in step 2, the waiter had 7.5 tables.\nTherefore, the waiter had 7.5 tables in his section.\nCongratulations, detective!

Since each friend had 8.0 lives, the total number of lives the friends had was 5.0 x 8.0 = 40.0 lives.\nStep 2: Now, let's use Clue 2 to find out how many lives the new players had. Since 2.0 more players joined the game, the total number of lives the players had increased by 2.0 x 8.0 = 16.0 lives.\nStep 3: Now, let's add the total number of lives the original friends had to the total number of lives the new players had to find out the total number of lives the players had now.

If the waiter got $3.0 each from the customers who tipped, then we need to multiply that amount by the number of customers who tipped.\nSo, if 5.0 customers did not leave a tip, and each of them gave $3.0, then the total amount of money the waiter earned from tips is:\n5.0 customers x $3.0 per customer = $15.0\nNow, let's add this amount to the total number of customers the waiter served to find out how much money the waiter earned in total:\n10.0 customers x $15.0 per 5.0 customers = $150.0\nTherefore, the waiter earned $150.0 in total from serving 10.0 customers.\nBut wait, there's more! We still need to account for the 5.0 customers who did not leave a tip. Remember, we said earlier that 50% of the customers did not leave a tip. So, if 5.0 customers did not leave a tip, then the total number of customers who left a tip is:\n10.0 customers - 5.0 customers = 5.0 customers\nNow, let's calculate the")

We know that distance traveled is equal to speed multiplied by time traveled, so we can start by plugging in the values we know into the equation:\nDistance = Speed x Time\nIn this case, the distance traveled by Joan is 25.0 miles, so we can start by finding the time she spent traveling:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nPlugging in the values we know, we get:\nTime = 25.0 miles / 5.0 miles/hour = 5.0 hours\nSo, Joan traveled for 5.0 hours at a speed of 5.0 miles per hour.\nBut wait, there's more! We can also use the equation to find out how long Joan was actually traveling. Remember, time is equal to distance divided by speed:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nSo, if we want to find out how long Joan was traveling, we can use the same equation:\nTime = 25.0 miles / 5.0 miles/hour = 5.0 hours\nBut wait, there's a twist!

(HINT: You can use the conversion factors we established earlier to help you.)\nSolution:\n🔮 By combining the volume of walnuts and almonds, we can find out how many cups of nuts Karen put in the trail mix.\n0.25 cup of walnuts = 1/4 cup\n0.25 cup of almonds = 1/4 cup\nTotal volume of nuts = 0.25 cup + 0.25 cup = 0.5 cups\nTherefore, Karen put 0.5 cups of nuts in the trail mix.

We know that 489.0 is a portion of 2778.0, so we can set up the equation:\n2778.0 = 489.0 + x\nWhere x is the number of marbles Carla had before she bought any more.\nStep 2: Now we solve the equation we just set up. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 489.0:\n5.6 = x\nSo Carla had 5.6 marbles before she bought any more.\nStep 3: Now that we know how many marbles Carla had before she bought any more, we can find out how many she bought by subtracting the number of marbles she already had from the total number of marbles she has now:\n2778.0 - 5.6 = 489.0\nSo Carla bought 432.4 marbles (2778.0 - 5.6 = 432.4).\nStep 4: Finally, we can find out how many marbles Carla started with by adding the number of marbles she already had to the number of marbles she bought:\n5.6 + 432.4 = 438.0\nSo Carla started with 438.0 marbles.\nTherefore, the answer to the mystery is: Carla started with 438.0 marbles.")

If Darnel sprinted 0.875 laps and then took a break by jogging 0.75 laps, that means he covered a total distance of:\n0.875 laps + 0.75 laps = 1.625 laps\nBut wait, we're not done yet! We need to convert the distance from laps to a more manageable unit, like meters or kilometers. Let's assume that each lap is equal to 400 meters (a common distance for a track).\n1.625 laps x 400 meters/lap = 650 meters\nTherefore, Darnel sprinted 650 meters farther than he jogged.\nSolved! 🎉")

We know that the total number of yellow balloons that Fred, Sam, and Mary have is equal to the total number of balloons they have. So, we can start by adding up the number of yellow balloons that each of them has:\nFred has 5.0 yellow balloons, so he has a total of 5.0 + 5.0 = 10.0 yellow balloons.\nSam has 6.0 yellow balloons, so he has a total of 6.0 + 6.0 = 12.0 yellow balloons.\nMary has 7.0 yellow balloons, so she has a total of 7.0 + 7.0 = 14.0 yellow balloons.\nNow, we need to find out how many yellow balloons they have in total. To do this, we add up the total number of yellow balloons that each of them has:\n10.0 + 12.0 + 14.0 = 36.0\nSo, Fred, Sam, and Mary have a total of 36.0 yellow balloons! Great job, detectives!")

We can start by using the information from Clue 1 to find out how many pastries Wendy sold. Since Wendy made pastries for the bake sale, that means she sold some of them. So, the number of pastries Wendy sold is equal to the number of pastries she made minus the number she had left after the sale.\nPastries made by Wendy = 4.0 cupcakes + 29.0 cookies = 33.0 pastries\nNow, let's use the information from Clue 3 to find out how many pastries Wendy sold. We know that Wendy had 24.0 pastries left after the sale, so we can subtract that number from the number of pastries she made to find out how many she sold.\nNumber of pastries sold = 33.0 - 24.0 = 9.0 pastries\nSo, Wendy sold 9.0 pastries at the bake sale!

We want to find out how many markers are in each package, so we divide the total number of markers (40.0) by the number of packages (7.0):\n40.0 ÷ 7.0 = 5.7\nStep 3: Round the result to the nearest whole number. Since we have a decimal result, we need to round it to the nearest whole number. In this case, rounding up gives us 6 markers in each package.\nTherefore, the final solution is:\nMrs. Hilt has 6 markers in each package.")

Here are the clues we have:\nClue 1: Mrs. Hilt read 4.0 books.\nClue 2: Each book had 17.0 chapters.\nNow, let\'s use our detective skills to solve the mystery step by step:\nStep 1: Convert the number of books Mrs. Hilt read to a decimal. Since 4.0 is a decimal, we can skip this step.\nStep 2: Convert the number of chapters in each book to a decimal. Since 17.0 is a decimal, we can skip this step too.\nStep 3: Multiply the number of books Mrs. Hilt read by the number of chapters in each book.\nMrs. Hilt read 4.0 books, and each book had 17.0 chapters, so:\n4.0 x 17.0 = 68.0\nTherefore, Mrs. Hilt read 68 chapters in total.\nStep 4: Check our answer. Did Mrs. Hilt really read 68 chapters?\nLet\'s go back to the problem statement: "Mrs. Hilt read 4.0 books." If we divide the number of chapters she read by the number of books she read, we get:\n68.0 ÷ 4.0 = 17.0\nYes, our answer checks out! Mrs. Hilt really read 17 chapters in each of the 4 books she read, for a total of 68 chapters.\nGreat job, detective! We\'ve solved the mystery of how many chapters Mrs. Hilt read.')

Let's dive in and solve it like a detective.\nClue #1: The restaurant served 9.0 pizzas during lunch.\nGreat, let's start by using this information to find out how many pizzas were served during lunch. We know that the restaurant served 9.0 pizzas, so we can multiply this number by the number of hours lunch lasted to find out the total number of pizzas served during lunch.\nLet's assume that lunch lasted for 2 hours. So, we multiply 9.0 pizzas by 2 hours to get:\n9.0 x 2 = 18.0\nClue #2: The restaurant served 6.0 pizzas during dinner.\nNow, let's use this information to find out how many pizzas were served during dinner. We know that the restaurant served 6.0 pizzas, so we can multiply this number by the number of hours dinner lasted to find out the total number of pizzas served during dinner.\nLet's assume that dinner lasted for 3 hours. So, we multiply 6.0 pizzas by 3 hours to get:\n6.0 x 3 = 18.0\nClue #3: The total number of pizzas served today is 18.0 + 18.0 = 36.0 pizzas.\nWow, great!

Multiplying that by 7.0 tickets per ride, we get 35.0 tickets used for the ferris wheel (5.0 x 7.0 = 35.0).\nFrom Clue 2, we know Oliver rode the bumper cars 4.0 times. Multiplying that by 7.0 tickets per ride, we get 28.0 tickets used for the bumper cars (4.0 x 7.0 = 28.0).\nSo, the total number of tickets used by Oliver is 35.0 + 28.0 = 63.0 tickets.\nStep 2: Determine how many tickets Oliver used for each ride.\nSince we know the total number of tickets used is 63.0, and each ride cost 7.0 tickets, we can divide the total number of tickets used by the number of rides to find out how many tickets Oliver used for each ride:\n63.0 tickets / 5.0 rides = 1.26 tickets per ride (for the ferris wheel)\n63.0 tickets / 4.0 rides = 1.57 tickets per")

We need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the total number of new oranges added. 🤔\nSo, if we subtract 9.0 from 38.0, we get... 🔍\n38.0 - 9.0 = 29.0\nTherefore, there are 29.0 oranges in the bin now! 🎉\nBut wait, there's more! Let's make sure we're accurate with our answer. 🤓\nSo, if there were originally 31.0 oranges in the bin, and 9.0 were thrown away, that means there were 31.0 - 9.0 = 22.0 oranges left in the bin. 🤝\nAnd then, if 38.0 new oranges were added to the bin, that means there are 22.0 + 38.0 = 60.0 oranges in the bin now! 😍\nSo, the final answer is... 🎉\nThere are 60.0 oranges in the bin! 🍊\nJob well done, detective!

So, we can write an equation:\nB + N = 30\nStep 4: Solve the Equation\nNow, we need to solve for "B" (the original number of dogs barking). We know that "B" + "N" = 30, so we can subtract "N" from both sides:\nB + N = 30\nSubtracting "N" from both sides gives us:\nB = 20\nSo, there are 20 dogs originally barking, and 10 more dogs start to bark, making a total of 30 dogs barking. 🐾💡\nStep 5: Summarize the Evidence\nWe have gathered the following clues:\n* Initially, 30 dogs are barking (B = 30)\n* 10 more dogs start to bark (N = 10)\n* The total number of dogs barking is equal to the original number of dogs barking plus the new number of dogs barking (B + N = 30)\n* Solving for "B" gives us the original number of dogs barking (B = 20)\nSo, the final solution is: 20 dogs originally barking, and 10 more dogs start to bark, making a total of 30 dogs barking. ��')

We can start by using the information from Clue 1 to find out how much honey Diane harvested last year per hive. We know that Diane has new hives this year, so we can assume that she had fewer hives last year.

Since there are 6.0 candies in the pile, and each candy comes in a package of 15.0, we can divide the number of candies by the number of packages per candy:\n6.0 candies ÷ 15.0 packages/candy = 0.4 packages\nSo, there are 0.4 packages of candies in the pile.\nStep 2: Now that we know there are 0.4 packages of candies in the pile, let's find out how many candies are in each package. Using Clue 2, we can divide the number of packages by the number of candies in each package:\n0.4 packages ÷ 15.0 candies/package = 0.267 packages\nSo, there are approximately 0.267 packages of candies in the pile.\nStep 3: Now that we know there are approximately 0.267 packages of candies in the pile, let's add the number of candies in each package to find the total number of candies in the pile.

(691, " Great! Let's solve this mystery by gathering clues and using our detective skills. Here are the clues we have:\nClue 1: Melissa has 70.0 oranges.\nClue 2: John takes 19.0 oranges away from Melissa.\nNow, let's use our detective skills to solve the mystery. We can start by using the information from Clue 1 to find out how many oranges Melissa had initially. We can do this by dividing 70.0 by 100.0, since there are 100.0 oranges in a whole orange:\n70.0 ÷ 100.0 = 0.70\nSo, Melissa had 0.70 oranges initially.\nNext, we can use the information from Clue 2 to find out how many oranges John took away from Melissa. We can do this by subtracting 19.0 from 0.70:\n0.70 - 19.0 = 0.51\nSo, John took away 0.51 oranges from Melissa.\nNow, let's use the information from Clue 1 to find out how many oranges Melissa has left after John took away the 0.51 oranges:\n70.0 - 0.51 = 69.49\nSo, Melissa has 69.49 oranges left after John took away the 0.51 oranges.\nTherefore, the final answer is: Melissa has 69.49 oranges left after John took away 19.0 oranges.")

Here are the clues we have:\nClue #1: Sam poured 1.0 bucket of water into the plastic wading pool.\nClue #2: A few minutes later, Sam added another 8.8 buckets of water to the pool.\nNow, let's use our detective skills to gather more information and build up to the final solution step by step:\nStep 1: Convert the amount of water poured in the first bucket to a common unit, such as liters. We know that 1.0 bucket is equal to 0.032 cubic meters (since there are 1000 liters in 1 cubic meter). So, Sam poured 0.032 cubic meters of water into the pool.\nStep 2: Convert the amount of water added in the second bucket to a common unit, such as liters. We know that 8.8 buckets is equal to 0.296 cubic meters (since there are 1000 liters in 1 cubic meter). So, Sam added 0.296 cubic meters of water to the pool.\nStep 3: Add the amount of water poured in the first bucket to the amount of water added in the second bucket. Since we converted both amounts to the same unit (liters), we can simply add them: 0.032 + 0.296 = 0.328 cubic meters.\nStep 4: Convert the final answer to the original unit, buckets. Since there are 1000 liters in 1 bucket, we can divide the total amount of water by 1000: 0.328 cubic meters / 1000 = 0.328 buckets.\nTherefore, Sam poured 0.328 buckets of water into the plastic")

Since the first 2500 minutes are free, we don't have to pay for those. But for each minute thereafter, we have to pay $0.25. So, the total cost of the minutes used can be calculated as follows:\nTotal cost = Number of minutes used x Cost per minute\n= 25000 (free minutes) + (Number of minutes over 2500 x $0.25)\nStep 2: Now, let's find out how many minutes are over 2500. To do this, we can subtract the number of free minutes (2500) from the total number of minutes used (112.45).\nNumber of minutes over 2500 = Total minutes used - 2500\n= 112.45 - 2500\n= 87.45\nStep 3: Now that we know the number of minutes over 2500, we can find out how many minutes were in use by multiplying the number of minutes over 2500 by the cost per minute.\nMinutes in use = Number of minutes over 25")

Here are the clues we've been given:\nClue 1: The book is on sale for 10.0% off.\nClue 2: The regular price of the book is $27.90.\nNow, let's use our detective skills to build up to the final solution. Here's our reasoning:\nStep 1: Calculate the discount amount\nSince the book is on sale for 10.0% off, we can calculate the discount amount by multiplying the regular price by the discount percentage.\nDiscount amount = Regular price x Discount percentage\nDiscount amount = $27.90 x 10.0%\nDiscount amount = $2.79\nStep 2: Calculate the sale price\nNow that we have the discount amount, we can calculate the sale price by subtracting the discount amount from the regular price.\nSale price = Regular price - Discount amount\nSale price = $27.90 - $2.79\nSale price = $25.11\nStep 3: Check if the sale price is a reasonable amount\nAs detectives, we want to make sure the sale price is a reasonable amount. Let's check if $25.11 is a reasonable price for a book.\nHmm, $25.11 seems like a reasonable price for a book.

This gives us the number of shelves Oliver will need:\n46 books / 4 books per shelf = 11.5 shelves\nSince you can't have a fraction of a shelf, we'll round up to the nearest whole number: 12 shelves.\nStep 2: Now that we know how many shelves Oliver will need, let's calculate the number of books he will have left to put away after the librarian takes 10 books.\n46 books - 10 books = 36 books\nSo, Oliver will have 36 books left to put away after the librarian takes 10 books.\nStep 3: Finally, let's check if our answer makes sense based on the clues we have. If Oliver has 36 books left to put away and can fit 4 books on a shelf, then he will need:\n36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves\nThis matches the answer we got in step 1, so we know our solution is correct!\nTherefore, Oliver will need 12 shelves to put away the 46 books, and he will have 9 shelves left over after the librarian takes 10")

Since she picked 45.0 flowers and made bouquets with 5.0 flowers in each one, the total number of flowers she had to work with is:\n45.0 x 5.0 = 225.0 flowers\nStep 2: Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets Wendy could make with the total number of flowers she had to work with. Since 35.0 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, the number of bouquets Wendy could make is:\n225.0 - 35.0 = 175.0 bouquets\nStep 3: Finally, let's convert the number of bouquets from a decimal to a whole number. Since 175.0 is a decimal, let's round it up to the nearest whole number:\n175.0 ÷ 10 = 17 bouquets\nTherefore, Wendy could still make 17 bouquets for her friend's wedding. Great job, detective!")

This means he has 22.0 books left, and he also gained 23.0 new books.\nStep 3: Build the Solution\nNow, let's use the information we gathered to solve the mystery:\nAdam had 33.0 books initially, and he sold 11.0 of them. So, he has 33.0 - 11.0 = 22.0 books left.\nThen, he used the money he earned from selling his books to buy 23.0 new books. This means he has 22.0 books left, and he also gained 23.0 new books, for a total of 45.0 books (22.0 + 23.0).\nTherefore, Adam has 45.0 books in total: 22.0 books he still has, and 23.0 new books he acquired. 📚\nStep 4: Confirm the Solution\nTo confirm our solution, let's go")

So, let\'s call this quantity "x".\nx = 76.0 - 59.0\nStep 2: Simplify the equation\nWe can simplify the equation by subtracting 59.0 from 76.0:\nx = 17.0\nStep 3: Check if the solution is reasonable\nLet\'s see if the solution makes sense. If Brian had 76.0 cards and Wayne took away 59.0 cards, it\'s reasonable to assume that Brian will have fewer cards than he did before. So, the solution of 17.0 cards seems reasonable.\nStep 4: Confirm the solution\nTo confirm the solution, let\'s go back to the clues. We know that Brian had 76.0 cards and Wayne took away 59.0 cards. So, if we multiply the number of cards Brian had by the number of cards Wayne took away, we should get the number of cards Brian will have after the takeaway:\n76.0 x 59.0 = 4344.0\nBut, we know that Brian will have 17.0 cards after the takeaway. So, we can set up the equation:\n4344.0 - 59.0 = 17.0\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 4265.0\nTherefore, Brian will have 17.0 cards after Wayne takes away 59.0 cards.\nStep 5: Summarize')

Let's dive into the clues and solve this puzzle like the detective we are.\nClue #1: The builder has already installed 6.0 windows.\nGreat, let's start by using this information to find out how long it took the builder to install the 6.0 windows that have already been installed. If it takes 5.0 hours to install each window, then the total time it took to install the 6.0 windows is:\n6.0 windows x 5.0 hours/window = 30.0 hours\nClue #2: The building needs 10.0 windows in total.\nNow that we know how long it took to install the 6.0 windows that have already been installed, we can use this information to find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining 4.0 windows. To do this, we can divide the total number of windows (10.0) by the number of windows that have already been installed (6.0):\n10.0 windows / 6.0 installed windows = 1.67\nSo, it will take the builder approximately 1.67 times longer to install the remaining 4.0 windows than it took to install the 6.0 windows that have already been installed.\nClue #3: It takes 5.0 hours to install each window.\nGreat, let's use this information to find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining 4.0 windows. We can multiply the number of windows that need to be installed (4.0) by the time it takes to install each window (5.0 hours):\n4.0 windows x 5.0 hours/window = 20.0 hours\nSo, it will take the builder approximately 20.0 hours to install the remaining 4.0 windows")

Let's assume there is one rollercoaster in the area.\nClue #2: 7.0 students rode the rollercoaster every 5.0 minutes.\nWow, that's a lot of students! If 7 students ride every 5 minutes, that means there are 7 x 12 = 84 students who ride the rollercoaster in an hour.\nClue #3: It has been 15.0 minutes since Mrs. Hilt saw the rollercoaster.\nNow we need to find out how many students rode the rollercoaster in those 15 minutes.

We need at least 4 buses to take the entire group on the field trip.\nStep 2: Ask ourselves, "How many students can each bus accommodate?"\nSince there are 7.0 seats on each bus, we can fit 7.0 students on each bus.\n7.0 students/bus = 2.8 buses needed (rounded up to the nearest whole number)\nWow, we\'re getting closer to the solution! We now need at least 2.8 buses to transport all 28.0 students on the field trip.\nStep 3: Check if our calculations are correct.\nLet\'s double-check our math:\n4.0 buses needed (from Step 1) × 7.0 seats/bus = 28.0 seats available (on all 4 buses)\n28.0 seats available ÷ 7.0 students/bus = 4.0 buses needed (which we already calculated in Step 2)\nAha!

Here are the clues we have:\nClue 1: Rosa had 67.0 flowers initially.\nClue 2: Andre gave Rosa some more flowers.\nClue 3: Now, Rosa has 90.0 flowers.\nUsing these clues, we can start building up to the final solution step by step:\nStep 1: Let's start by using Clue 1 to find out how many flowers Rosa had initially. We know that Rosa had 67.0 flowers, so we can write this down as our first equation:\n67.0 = x\nWhere x is the number of flowers Rosa had initially.\nStep 2: Now, let's use Clue 2 to find out how many more flowers Andre gave to Rosa. We know that Rosa has 90.0 flowers now, so we can write this down as our second equation:\n90.0 = x + 67.0\nWhere x is the number of flowers Andre gave to Rosa.\nStep 3: Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Let's solve for x (the number of flowers Andre gave to Rosa) in the second equation:\nx + 67.0 = 90.0\nSubtract 67.0 from both sides:\nx = 23.0\nSo Andre gave Rosa 23.0 flowers.\nStep 4: Now we can use the first equation to find out how many flowers Rosa had initially:\n67.0 = x\nDivide both sides by 67.0:\nx / 67.0 = 0.67\nSo Rosa had initially 0.67 x 67.0 = 44.9 flowers.\nTherefore, Andre gave Rosa 23.0 flowers, and Rosa had initially 44.9 flowers.")

We know that Martin strolled to Lawrence's house, which means he was walking at a slow pace. We also know that it took him 6.0 hours to get there, which means he was walking at a constant rate for 6.0 hours.\nTo find out how fast Martin was walking, we can use the formula:\ndistance = speed x time\nWe know the distance between Martin's house and Lawrence's house is 12.0 miles, so we can plug that value into the formula:\nspeed = distance / time\nWe also know that time is 6.0 hours, so we can plug that value into the formula:\nspeed = 12.0 miles / 6.0 hours\nNow, we need to solve for speed.

I jot down the note in my journal. "So, if he had $12.0 left after buying the ticket, and he spent $3.0 on the hot dog, that means he has $12.0 - $3.0 = $9.0 left."\nNow we have our final answer: Tony had $9.0 left after buying the ticket and the hot dog.

Now, how can we use this information to find out how much chain can be purchased with 7.5 dollars?\nStep 1: Divide the cost of 5.0 feet of chain by the length of chain.\n5.0 feet x 2.0 dollars/foot = 10.0 dollars\nNow we know that 10.0 dollars can buy 5.0 feet of chain.\nStep 2: Find out how many feet of chain 7.5 dollars can buy.\n7.5 dollars / 10.0 dollars/foot = 0.75 feet\nWow, that's not very much! Can we buy more than 0.75 feet of chain with 7.5 dollars? Let's keep investigating.\nStep 3: Convert the length of chain from feet to inches.\n5.0 feet x 12.0 inches/foot = 60.0 inches\nNow we can see that 7.5 dollars can buy approximately 60.0 inches of chain.\nStep 4: Use the conversion rate to find out how many feet of chain 60.0 inches can buy.\n60.0 inches / 12.0 inches/foot = 5.0 feet\nAh-ha!

If there are 4 tables and 32.0 customers in the section, then there are 32.0 / 4 = 8.0 customers at each table.\nSo, each table in the waiter's section had 8.0 customers.\nAnd there you have it, folks! The waiter had 4 tables in his section, and each table had 8.0 customers.\nFinal solution: The waiter had 4 tables and 32.0 customers in his section.")

So, Isabel could make 2 packages of cupcakes. 📦\nGreat job, detective! With 2 packages of cupcakes, Isabel could make 66.0 cupcakes in total (39.0 cupcakes x 2 packages = 78.0 cupcakes, but we rounded up to 2 packages, so we subtract 13.0 cupcakes). 😊\nNow, let's summarize our findings:\nIsabel baked 39.0 cupcakes for the bake sale.\nTodd ate 21.0 of the cupcakes.\nIsabel could make 2 packages of cupcakes, with 3.0 cupcakes in each package.\nTherefore, Isabel could make a total of 66.0 cupcakes (2 packages x 3.0 cupcakes per package = 66.0 cupcakes")

This means that the number of games they won is greater than the number of games they lost.\nStep 2: We know that the team was defeated during 4.0 games, which means that the number of games they lost is equal to 4.0.\nStep 3: Now, let's use the information that the team played 12.0 games to find out how many games they won. Since they won most of their games, the number of games they won must be greater than the number of games they lost. So, we can set up the equation:\nNumber of games won = 12.0 - 4.0\nStep 4: Now, let's solve the equation.

(1324, " Great! Let's solve this mystery like a detective. Here are the clues we have:\nClue 1: Jessica had 8.0 quarters in her bank.\nClue 2: Her sister borrowed 3.0 of her quarters.\nNow, let's use these clues to solve the mystery.\nStep 1: Let's start by using the information from Clue 1 to find out how many quarters Jessica had originally. We can do this by dividing 8.0 by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a dollar). So, Jessica had 2.0 quarters originally.\nStep 2: Now, let's use the information from Clue 2 to find out how many quarters Jessica's sister borrowed. We can do this by multiplying the number of quarters Jessica had by the fraction of quarters her sister borrowed. Since her sister borrowed 3.0 quarters, we can multiply 2.0 (the number of quarters Jessica had) by 3.0 to find out how many quarters her sister borrowed. So, her sister borrowed 6.0 quarters.\nStep 3: Now that we know how many quarters Jessica had and how many her sister borrowed, we can find out how many quarters Jessica has now. We can simply subtract the number of quarters her sister borrowed from the number of quarters Jessica had. So, Jessica has 2.0 - 6.0 = -4.0 quarters now.\nStep 4: But wait, we can't have negative quarters! So, let's check our work. We know that Jessica had 2.0 quarters originally, and her sister borrowed 6.0 quarters. That means Jessica had a total of 2.0 + 6.0 = 8.0 quarters. So, Jessica still has 8.0 quarters now.\nThere")

We know the total number of books in the bargain bin initially was 4.0, and then 3.0 books were sold.

So, if 1 cube of hair is equal to 18.0 inches, then 4.0 more inches of hair will be equal to 4.0 x 18.0 = 72.0 inches.\nStep 3: How long will Isabella's hair be after it grows 4.0 more inches?\nNow that we know that Isabella's hair will grow by 72.0 inches, we can find out how long it will be after it grows that amount. To do this, we can divide the total length of hair that will grow (72.0 inches) by the length of 1 cube of hair (18.0 inches):\n72.0 inches ÷ 18.0 inches/cube = 4.0 cubes\nSo, after Isabella's hair grows 4.0 more inches, it will be 4.0 cubes long.\nStep 4: How many inches is 4.0 cubes of hair?\nNow that we know that Isabella's hair will be ")

That's a helpful piece of information.\nClue #3: The toy store used shelves to display the bears.\nThis is a crucial clue, as it tells us that the bears were not just randomly placed on the floor or in a pile. They were actually placed on shelves, which suggests that the store had a specific way of organizing the bears.\nNow, let's put all of these clues together to solve the mystery.\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of bears the store had.\nUsing the clues we've gathered, we can calculate the total number of bears the store had. If the store had 4.0 bears in stock initially, and then received another shipment of 10.0 bears, the total number of bears the store had would be:\n4.0 + 10.0 = 14.0 bears\nStep 2: Determine how many shelves the store used.\nNow that we know the total number of bears the store had, we can calculate how many shelves they used")

Here are the clues we have:\nClue 1: Heather starts with 86.0 blocks.\nClue 2: Heather shares 41.0 blocks with Jose.\nNow, let's use these clues to find out how many blocks Heather ends up with.\nStep 1: Let's calculate the number of blocks Heather shared with Jose. We know that Heather shared 41.0 blocks with Jose, so we can divide the number of blocks Heather had (86.0) by the number of blocks she shared (41.0) to find out how many blocks Heather had left after sharing:\n86.0 ÷ 41.0 = 2.0\nSo, Heather had 2.0 blocks left after sharing 41.0 blocks with Jose.\nStep 2: Now that we know how many blocks Heather had left after sharing, we can find out how many blocks she has now. We know that Heather had 2.0 blocks left after sharing, and she had 86.0 blocks to start with, so we can add the number of blocks she had left after sharing to the number of blocks she had at the start to find out how many blocks she has now:\n86.0 + 2.0 = 88.0\nSo, Heather has 88.0 blocks now.\nTherefore, the answer to the mystery is: Heather has 88.0 blocks now.")

Let's get started by gathering our clues:\nClue #1: The pet store had 56 puppies in total.\nClue #2: The store sold 24 puppies in one day.\nClue #3: The remaining puppies were placed in cages with 4 puppies in each cage.\nNow, let's use our detective skills to build up to the final solution. Here's how we can do it:\nStep 1: Let's start by using Clue #1 to find out how many cages the pet store would need to hold all 56 puppies. Since each cage can hold 4 puppies, we can divide 56 by 4 to get the total number of cages needed:\n56 ÷ 4 = 14\nSo, the pet store would need 14 cages to hold all the puppies.\nStep 2: Now, let's use Clue #2 to find out how many cages the store actually used after selling some of the puppies. If the store sold 24 puppies, that means there are now fewer puppies in the store. Let's divide the original number of puppies (56) by the number of puppies left in the store after the sale (56 - 24 = 32):\n14 (cages needed) × 32 (puppies left in store) = 432\nSo, the pet store actually used 432 cages to hold all the puppies after selling some of them.\nStep 3: Finally, let's use Clue #3 to find out how many puppies are left in each cage.

If there are 54 scissors in the drawer initially, and Keith placed 22 scissors in the drawer, then he must have taken out 54 - 22 = 32 scissors.\nStep 2: Now that we know how many scissors Keith took out of the drawer, let's use the information from Clue 2 to find out how many scissors are left in the drawer after he placed them.

We can do this by adding the number of scissors Keith took out of the drawer to the number of scissors left in the drawer. So, if Keith took out 32 scissors and there are 32 scissors left in the drawer, then there are a total of 32 + 32 = 64 scissors now there in all.\nAnd there you have it!

Since there were 16 friends playing, each friend had 8 lives (as stated in Clue 3), so the total number of lives the friends had before 7 players quit was:\n16 friends x 8 lives per friend = 128 lives\nStep 2: Now, let's use Clue 2 to find out how many lives the 7 players who quit had.

If each player had 3.0 lives, and 3.0 players quit, then the total number of lives left playing must be 5.0 x 3.0 = 15.0 lives.\nClue #3: The total number of lives must be a multiple of 3.0.\n🔎 Hmm, that's interesting. Since the total number of lives must be a multiple of 3.0, we can narrow it down to the following possibilities: 15.0, 21.0, 27.0, 33.0, 39.0, or 45.0 lives.\nClue #4: The total number of lives is a power of 3.0.\n🔓 Ah, now we're getting somewhere! Since the total number of lives is a power of 3.0, we can deduce that it must be one of the following: 3^3 = 27.0 lives, 3^4 = 33.0 lives, 3^5 = 39.0 lives, or 3^6 = 45.0 lives.\nClue #5: The total number of lives is 33.0.\n🎉 Ah, the mystery is solved!

We know that the total number of carrots picked by Nancy and her mother is 38.0 + 47.0 = 85.0 carrots.\nBut, as you said, only 71.0% of the carrots were good. That means the number of good carrots is 71.0% of 85.0 = 60.9 carrots.\nSo, the number of bad carrots is 85.0 - 60.9 = 24.1 carrots.\nTherefore, Nancy and her mother had 24.1 bad carrots in their garden.\nBut wait, there's more! We can also calculate the percentage of bad carrots out of the total number of carrots picked. To do this, we divide the number of bad carrots by the total number of carrots picked:\nPercentage of bad carrots = (24.1 / 85.0) x 100% = 28.5%\nTherefore, 28.5% of the carrots picked by Nancy and her mother were bad.\nAnd there you have it, folks!

This means that the amount of water that leaked out of the bucket is equal to the total amount of water initially put into the bucket minus the amount of water that remained in the bucket after the specified time.\nUsing the calculations from Step 1, we can determine the amount of water that leaked out of the bucket:\nAmount of water that leaked out = Total amount of water initially put into the bucket - Amount of water remaining in the bucket after the specified time\n= 231 cubic inches - 0.5 gallons\n= 226.5 cubic inches\n\nSo, there were 226.5 cubic inches of water that leaked out of the bucket.\nTo convert this to gallons, we can divide the number of cubic inches by 231 (since 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches):\n")

Let's assume that the Cookie Mom has a fixed number of cases, which we will call x.\nSince Karen picks up cases from the Cookie Mom, the total number of cases Karen picks up is equal to the number of cases the Cookie Mom has (x) plus the number of cases Karen sold (432.0).\nSo, we can set up the following equation:\nx + 432.0 = ?\nStep 3: Solve the equation using the information given in the problem.\nWe are given that the Cookie Mom has 12.0 cases per box, and Karen sold 36.0 boxes. So, the total number of cases the Cookie Mom has is:\nx = 36.0 boxes × 12.0 cases/box = 432.0 cases\nTherefore, Karen picks")

(1679, " Ah, a mystery to solve! Let's get started, my dear detective. 🕵️\u200d♀️\nStep 1: Gather Clues\nWe know that Mrs. Sheridan has 17.0 cats initially. Now, we are told that Mr. Sheridan gave her 14.0 more cats. So, let's write down what we know so far:\nClue 1: Mrs. Sheridan has 17.0 cats initially.\nStep 2: Analyze the Clues\nNow, let's analyze the clues we have. We know that Mrs. Sheridan has 17.0 cats initially, and Mr. Sheridan gave her 14.0 more cats. So, if we add the initial number of cats to the number of cats Mr. Sheridan gave her, we get:\n17.0 + 14.0 = 31.0\nStep 3: Draw Conclusions\nNow, we have a total of 31.0 cats. Therefore, the final answer is:\nMrs. Sheridan has 31.0 cats altogether. 🐱\nConclusion:\nMrs. Sheridan has 31.0 cats altogether, including the 17.0 cats she already had and the 14.0 more cats given to her by Mr. Sheridan. 🎉\nWell done, detective!

(1680, " Great! Let's solve this mystery like a detective would. Here are the clues we have:\nClue 1: There are 84.0 leaves.\nClue 2: There are 139.0 ladybugs on each leaf.\nNow, let's use these clues to find the total number of ladybugs.\nStep 1: Multiply the number of leaves by the number of ladybugs on each leaf.\n84.0 leaves x 139.0 ladybugs/leaf = 11,520.0 ladybugs\nStep 2: Check if the answer is a reasonable number.\n11,520.0 ladybugs seems like a lot, but it's a reasonable number considering the size of a leaf and the number of ladybugs that can fit on it. Let's continue with the calculation.\nStep 3: Add up all the ladybugs from each leaf.\n111,520.0 ladybugs/leaf x Number of leaves = Total number of ladybugs\nNow, let's use the number of leaves we were given earlier:\nTotal number of ladybugs = 11,520.0 ladybugs/leaf x 84.0 leaves = 96,160.0 ladybugs\nTherefore, there are 96,160.0 ladybugs in all.\nGreat! We've solved the mystery of the ladybugs on the leaves. Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like to play another round of detective work.")

(1682, " Ah, a mystery to solve! Let's dive into the clues and solve this case like a detective.\nClue #1: Faye picked 23.0 carrots from the garden.\nClue #2: Faye's mother picked 5.0 carrots from the garden.\nClue #3: Only 12.0 of the carrots were good.\nNow, let's use our detective skills to solve the mystery. We know that Faye picked more carrots than her mother, so we can start by subtracting the number of carrots her mother picked from the total number of carrots picked by Faye:\n23.0 - 5.0 = 18.0\nNow, we need to find out how many good carrots Faye and her mother picked. We know that only 12.0 of the carrots were good, so we can subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked:\n18.0 - 12.0 = 6.0\nSo, Faye and her mother had 6.0 bad carrots.\nThere you have it, the solution to the mystery!")

(1683, " Ah, a pear-fect mystery! Let's dive in and solve it like a detective. Here are the clues we have:\nClue 1: Sara picked 35.0 pears from the orchard.\nClue 2: Sara gave 28.0 pears to Dan.\nNow, let's use our detective skills to solve the mystery. We know that Sara gave 28.0 pears to Dan, so that means she must have had more pears than she gave to Dan. In other words, her original amount of pears is greater than 28.0.\nSo, let's subtract the pears she gave to Dan from the total number of pears she picked:\n35.0 - 28.0 = 7.0\nTherefore, Sara has 7.0 pears left after giving some to Dan.\nBut wait, there's more! We also know that Sara picked 35.0 pears from the orchard. So, let's add the number of pears she picked to the number of pears she has left:\n7.0 + 35.0 = 42.0\nTherefore, Sara has 42.0 pears in total.\nAnd there you have it, folks! The mystery of Sara's pears is solved. She has 42.0 pears in total, including the ones she picked and the ones she gave to Dan. Great job, detectives!")

(1684, " Great! Let's solve this mystery like a detective. We have the following clues:\nClue 1: Third-grade students went to the concert.\nClue 2: 8.0 buses were used to transport the students to the concert.\nClue 3: Each bus could carry 45.0 students.\nNow, let's use our detective skills to build up to the final solution step by step:\nStep 1: Let's start by using Clue 1 to find out how many students went to the concert. Since the concert was attended by third-grade students, we know that the number of students is equal to the number of third-grade classes in the school.\nLet's assume there are x third-grade classes in the school.\nStep 2: Now, let's use Clue 2 to find out how many buses were needed to transport all the students to the concert. Since 8.0 buses were used, we can divide the total number of students by the number of buses to find out how many students each bus could carry:\nNumber of students per bus = Total number of students ÷ Number of buses\nNumber of students per bus = x students ÷ 8.0 buses\nStep 3: Now, let's use Clue 3 to find out how many students went to the concert. Since each bus could carry 45.0 students, we can multiply the number of students per bus by the number of buses to find out the total number of students who went to the concert:\nTotal number of students who went to the concert = Number of students per bus × Number of buses\nTotal number of students who went to the concert = x students ÷ 8.0 buses\nNow, let's substitute the values we have found:\nTotal number of students who went to the concert = x students ÷ 8.0 buses\nCan you solve for x?")
