Since he can only carry 8 trays at a time, he will make 125 / 8 = 15.625 trips to pick up all the trays from the first table.\n2. Now, let's consider the 7 trays from the second table. Since Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make 7 / 8 = 0.875 trips to pick up all the trays from the second table.\n3. To find out how many total trips Jerry will make, we need to add the number of trips he will make for each table. So, the total number of trips Jerry will make is 15.625 + 0.875 = 16.5 trips.\nTherefore, Jerry will make 16 trips to pick up all the lunch trays.")

Since Amanda walked at a rate of 4 miles per hour, she covered 4 x 120 minutes = 480 miles during the 2 hours she walked.\n4. To find the distance between Amanda's house and Kimberly's house, we need to use the formula: distance = rate x time. In this case, the rate is 4 miles per hour, and the time is 2 hours. So, the distance between Amanda's house and Kimberly's house is:\ndistance = 4 miles/hour x 2 hours = 8 miles\nTherefore, the distance between Amanda's house and Kimberly's house is 8 miles.")

Jones High School on a Monday after a significant snow fall was 218.0. To calculate this, we can use the formula:\nNumber of students absent = Total number of students x Percentage of students absent\nWe are given that the total number of students was 1487.0, so we can plug this value into the formula:\nNumber of students absent = 1487.0 x 0.218\nNumber of students absent = 312.36\n\nLayer 2: Calculate the total number of students who attend B. Jones High School\nWe know that the total attendance on that Monday was 1487.0, so the total number of students who attend B. Jones High School is:\nTotal number of students = Total attendance\nTotal number of students = 1487.0\n\nLayer 3: Find the answer to the problem\nNow that we have the number of students absent and the total number of students who attend B. Jones High School, we can find the answer to the problem by subtracting the number of students absent from the total number of students who attend:\nTotal number of students attending B. Jones High School = Total number of students who attend - Number of students absent\nTotal number of students attending B. Jones High School = 1487.0 - 312.36\nTotal number of students attending B.

To find the cost of the couch to the store, we need to calculate the cost of the couch before the mark-up.\nCost of couch to the store = $350.00\n\nLayer 2: Calculate the mark-up percentage\nThe mark-up percentage is 20.0%. To calculate the mark-up, we need to divide the cost of the couch to the store by the cost of the couch before the mark-up.\nMark-up percentage = ($350.00 / $350.00) x 100 = 20.0%\n\nLayer 3: Calculate the selling price of the couch\nNow that we have the cost of the couch to the store and the mark-up percentage, we can calculate the selling price of the couch. We can use the following formula:\nSelling price = Cost of couch to the store + Mark-up percentage x Cost of couch before the mark-up\nSelling price = $350.00 + (20.0% x $350.00) = $350.00 + $70.00 = $420.00\n\nTherefore, the selling price of the couch at the furniture store will be $420.00.")

Here's how we can calculate the original amount of grain that the ship contained:\nLayer 1: The ship is full of grain.\nThe problem states that the ship is full of grain, which means that the total amount of grain on the ship is equal to the capacity of the ship.\nLayer 2: The ship crashes into a coral reef.\nThe problem states that the ship crashes into a coral reef, which means that some of the grain on the ship is lost or damaged. We are not given the exact amount of grain that is lost or damaged, but we are told that 49952.0 tons of grain spill into the water.\nLayer 3: The ship is fixed.\nThe problem states that the ship is fixed, which means that the grain that was lost or damaged during the crash is now restored to its original state. This means that the total amount of grain on the ship is restored to its original amount.\nLayer 4: Only 918.0 tons of grain remain onboard.\nThe problem states that only 918.0 tons of grain remain onboard, which means that the total amount of grain on the ship is reduced by 49952.0 - 918.0 = 48034.0 tons.\nSo, to summarize, the ship originally contained 48034.0 tons of grain.")

Now, we need to find out how much fruit is left:\nTo find out how much fruit is left, we need to subtract the amount the class ate from the amount Gordon bought:\n21.7 ounces - 14.3 ounces = 7.4 ounces\n\nSo, there are 7.4 ounces of fruit left. To convert this to pounds, we can divide it by 16:\n7.4 ounces / 16 = 0.46 pounds\n\nTherefore, there are 0.46 pounds of fruit left.")

(1675, " Great! Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Determine the total number of bananas Ernest has:\n45.0 bananas\n\nStep 2: Find out how many boxes Ernest needs to use:\nIf Ernest has 45.0 bananas and there are 5.0 boxes, then Ernest needs 9.0 bananas per box (45.0 รท 5.0 = 9.0).\n\nStep 3: Determine how many cookies Julie brought to share with Ernest:\n3.0 cookies\n\nStep 4: Find out how many bananas Julie brought to share with Ernest:\nIf Julie brought 3.0 cookies and each cookie contains 0.6 bananas (a common ratio), then Julie brought 1.8 bananas (3.0 ร 0.6 = 1.8).\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total number of bananas Ernest and Julie have together:\nErnest has 9.0 bananas per box, and he needs 4 boxes to store all his bananas (9.0 ร 4 = 36.0 bananas). Julie brought 1.8 bananas, so together Ernest and Julie have 36.0 + 1.8 = 37.8 bananas.\n\nStep 6: Determine how many bananas must go in each box:\nTo find out how many bananas must go in each box, we divide the total number of bananas Ernest and Julie have (37.8 bananas) by the number of boxes Ernest needs to use (4 boxes). So, each box must contain:\n37.8 รท 4 = 9.4 bananas per box\n\nTherefore, Ernest must put away 9.4 bananas in each box.")

(1676, " Great problem! Let's break it down layer by layer:\n\nLayer 1: Cost of each chocolate bar\nThe problem states that each chocolate bar costs $6.0.\nLayer 2: Number of chocolate bars in a box\nThe problem states that a box has 13.0 bars total.\nLayer 3: Number of bars sold by Zoe\nThe problem states that Zoe sold all but 6.0 bars. This means she sold 6.0 bars and kept 6.0 bars.\nLayer 4: Calculating the total amount of money made\nTo find the total amount of money made, we need to multiply the number of bars sold by the cost of each bar.\nSo, the total amount of money made = Number of bars sold x Cost of each bar\n= 6.0 bars x $6.0\n= $36.0\n\nTherefore, Zoe made $36.0 by selling 6.0 bars of chocolate.")

(1678, " Great! Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\nKaren sold 36.0 boxes of Tagalongs.\nTo find out how many cases of 12.0 boxes Karen picks up from the Cookie Mom, we need to divide the number of boxes Karen sold by the number of boxes in a case.\nThere are 12.0 boxes in a case.\nSo, to find out how many cases Karen picks up, we can divide the number of boxes Karen sold by the number of boxes in a case:\n36.0 boxes / 12.0 boxes/case = 3 cases\n\nTherefore, Karen picks up 3 cases of Tagalongs from the Cookie Mom.")

Good carrots:\nYou said that only 12.0 of the carrots were good. So, the number of good carrots is 12.0.\n3. Bad carrots:\nTo find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked.\nBad carrots = Total carrots - Good carrots\nBad carrots = 28.0 - 12.0 = 16.0\n\nTherefore, Faye and her mother had 16.0 bad carrots.")
