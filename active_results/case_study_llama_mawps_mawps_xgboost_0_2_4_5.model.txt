prompted answer: There are 97.0 erasers in a box . Ernest has 17.0 erasers in a bag . Mark takes 97.0 erasers out of the box . How many erasers are left in the box ?"This is like a pot of stew, simmering to meld the flavors: "There are 97.0 erasers in a box. Ernest has 17.0 erasers in a bag. Mark takes 97.0 erasers out of the box. How many erasers are left in the box?"
Answer:
There are 79.0 erasers left in the box.
Explanation:
To find the number of erasers left in the box, we need to subtract the number of erasers taken by Mark from the total number of erasers in the box.
97.0 erasers in the box - 97.0 erasers taken by Mark = 0 erasers left in the box
So, there are 0 erasers left in the box.

Answer:
Kimberly has 5.0 Skittles initially.
When she buys 7.0 more Skittles, she now has 5 + 7 = 12 Skittles.
Later, when she buys 18.0 oranges at the store, she does not get any more Skittles. So, Kimberly still has 12 Skittles.
Therefore, Kimberly has 12 Skittles in all.

Answer:
Jeremy strolled for 10 hours.

Explanation:
To find out how long Jeremy strolled, we need to multiply the distance he traveled (20.0 kilometers) by the speed at which he traveled (2.0 kilometers per hour).
20.0 kilometers x 2.0 kilometers per hour = 40.0 hours
Since there are 1000 meters in 1 kilometer, we can convert the distance traveled from kilometers to meters:
20.0 kilometers x 1000 meters/kilometer = 20,000 meters
Now, we can divide the distance traveled (20,000 meters) by the speed at which Jeremy traveled (2.0 kilometers per hour) to find out how long he strolled:
20,000 meters รท 2.0 kilometers per hour = 10 hours
Therefore, Jeremy strolled for 10 hours.

If each member that did show up scored 6.0 points, how many points were scored total?""The answer to this problem is 12 points. Here's how we can calculate it:
1. The trivia team had 5.0 members total, so if 2.0 members didn't show up, that means there were 3.0 members who did show up.
2. Each member who did show up scored 6.0 points, so the total number of points scored by the 3.0 members who did show up is 3 x 6 = 18 points.
3. To find the total number of points scored, we add the points scored by the members who did show up to the points scored by the members who didn't show up: 18 + 0 = 18 points.
Therefore, the total number of points scored by the trivia team was 18 points."

Let's mix: "Luke's baseball cards" with "pages in binder" and see what happens!
Let's start by identifying the given information:
New cards: 3.0
Old cards: 9.0
Total number of cards: 3.0 + 9.0 = 12.0
Since Luke wants to organize his cards in a binder with 3.0 cards per page, he will need:
12.0 cards / 3.0 cards per page = 4 pages
So, Luke will use 4 pages to organize his baseball cards in his binder.

This means that Joan had 695 Pokemon cards in total, and 6 of them were torn or damaged.
Now, let's add the amount of Pokemon cards that Sara bought: "Sara bought 133.0 of Joan's Pokemon cards." This means that Sara bought 133 Pokemon cards from Joan.
So, how many Pokemon cards does Joan have now? We can find this out by subtracting the number of cards that Sara bought from Joan's original total: "695.0 - 133.0 = 562.0."

prompted answer: If Heather bicycled 40.0 kilometers at 8.0 kilometers per hour , how long was Heather bicycling ?"It's like mining for gems; we dig deep, assessing each discovery: "What is the context? What are the variables? What are the patterns?".
We must be careful not to jump to conclusions, to avoid the pitfalls of confirmation bias. We must be open to alternative explanations, to consider the possibility that our initial assumptions may be wrong.
In this case, we know that Heather bicycled for 40.0 kilometers, and we know her speed was 8.0 kilometers per hour. To find out how long she bicycled, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
Plugging in the values we know, we get:
Time = 40.0 kilometers / 8.0 kilometers per hour = 5.0 hours
So Heather bicycled for 5.0 hours.
