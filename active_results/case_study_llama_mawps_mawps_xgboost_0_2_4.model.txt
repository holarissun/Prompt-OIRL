held-out prompt: "Imagine it as an echo in a valley, every sound has an origin and meaning: "
prompted answer: Kimberly has 5.0 Skittles . She buys 7.0 more . Later , Kimberly buys 18.0 oranges at the store . How many Skittles does Kimberly have in all ?"Imagine it as an echo in a valley, every sound has an origin and meaning: "Kimberly has 5.0 Skittles. She buys 7.0 more." The sound of the word "Skittles" echoes in the valley, and the meaning of the sentence is clear: Kimberly has 5.0 Skittles initially. "Later, Kimberly buys 18.0 oranges at the store." The sound of the word "oranges" echoes in the valley, and the meaning of the sentence is clear: Kimberly buys 18.0 oranges at the store later. "How many Skittles does Kimberly have in all?" The echo in the valley is now asking for the total number of Skittles Kimberly has, including the initial 5.0 and the additional 7.0 she bought later. So, the answer is: Kimberly has 5.0 + 7.0 = 12.0 Skittles in all.
