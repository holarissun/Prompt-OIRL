prompted answer: Kimberly has 5.0 Skittles . She buys 7.0 more . Later , Kimberly buys 18.0 oranges at the store . How many Skittles does Kimberly have in all ?"Picture a gardener planting seeds. Each step, from soil preparation to watering, matters: "The gardener plants 3 seeds in each of 5 rows. How many seeds does the gardener plant in all?"
Answer:
Kimberly has 5.0 Skittles initially.
Kimberly buys 7.0 more Skittles, so now she has 5 + 7 = 12.0 Skittles.
Later, Kimberly buys 18.0 oranges at the store. Since oranges are not the same as Skittles, we don't add them to Kimberly's Skittle count. So, Kimberly still has 12.0 Skittles in all.

prompted answer: While playing at the arcade , Ned won 26.0 tickets playing ' whack a mole ' and 19.0 tickets playing ' skee ball ' . If he was trying to buy candy that cost 9.0 tickets a piece , how many could he buy ?"As a chemist mixing solutions, each ingredient alters the result. Let's mix: "Ned's Ticket Adventure" with "Candy Quest" to determine how many pieces of candy Ned can buy.
Tickets won:
26.0 tickets x 'whack a mole' = 26.0 tickets
19.0 tickets x'skee ball' = 19.0 tickets
Total tickets won = 45.0 tickets
Candy cost per ticket = 9.0 tickets
Number of tickets = Total tickets / Candy cost per ticket
Number of tickets = 45.0 tickets / 9.0 tickets = 5.0
Therefore, Ned can buy 5 pieces of candy.

prompted answer: If Anne wandered for 3.0 hours at 2.0 miles per hour . How far did Anne go ?"Like an athlete training for an event, every exercise has a purpose: "Anne wandered" means that she was not following a specific route or schedule, but rather moving around freely. The distance she traveled can be calculated by multiplying the time she wandered by her speed: distance = time x speed. In this case, Anne wandered for 3.0 hours, so the distance she traveled is: distance = 3.0 hours x 2.0 miles/hour = 6.0 miles. So, Anne went 6.0 miles while wandering.
