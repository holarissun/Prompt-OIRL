Љ� Razorback shop makes $210 off each jersey and $240 off each t-shirt.
Љ� During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys.
Љ� To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we need to subtract the price of a t-shirt from the price of a jersey.
Now, let's calculate the difference between the prices of t-shirts and jerseys:
$240 (price of a t-shirt) - $210 (price of a jersey) = $30
So, a t-shirt costs $30 more than a jersey.
Therefore, the answer is $30.
