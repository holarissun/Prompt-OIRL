prompted answer: a mailman has to give out 192 pieces of junk mail . if he goes to 4 blocks how many pieces of junk mail should he give each block ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "A mailman has to deliver 192 pieces of junk mail.
To determine how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give to each block, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of blocks he needs to deliver to.
Let's assume the mailman needs to deliver the junk mail to 4 blocks.
So, to calculate the number of pieces of junk mail each block should receive, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail (192) by the number of blocks (4):
192 รท 4 = 48
So, each block should receive 48 pieces of junk mail.

prompted answer: a chef used 39 cherries to make a pie . now he has 58 cherries left . how many cherries did he have before he made the pie ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Before Making the Pie" = 39 cherries"After Making the Pie" = 58 cherriesNow, let's solve the problem:Before making the pie, the chef had 39 cherries.
Let's assume the chef had x cherries before making the pie.
After making the pie, the chef has 58 cherries left.
So, the difference between the number of cherries the chef had before making the pie and the number of cherries he has after making the pie is:
x - 58 = 39
Now, we can solve for x:
x = 97
So, the chef had 97 cherries before making the pie.

prompted answer: paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday . at the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers . how many more crayons than erasers did he have left ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Crayons" and "Erasers" are two separate categories.
Crayons:
* Number of crayons Paul received: 531
* Number of crayons Paul had left at the end of the school year: 391
Erasers:
* Number of erasers Paul received: 38
* Number of erasers Paul had left at the end of the school year: 38
Now, let's find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left:
Number of crayons Paul had left = 391
Number of erasers Paul had left = 38
To find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left, we need to subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons:
391 - 38 = 353
So, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers left at the end of the school year.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how much paper Bianca and her friends recycled in total. We are given that Bianca recycled 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds, so the total amount of paper recycled is:
24 pounds + 3 pounds = 27 pounds
Since for every 3 pounds of paper recycled, they earn 1 point, Bianca and her friends earned a total of:
27 pounds x 1 point/3 pounds = 9 points
Therefore, Bianca and her friends earned 9 points for recycling paper.
