prompted answer: Sean has 9.0 apples . Susan gives Sean 8.0 more . Later , Sean buys 18.0 tickets at the store . How many apples does Sean have in all ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "Step 1: Sean has 9.0 apples initially.Step 2: Susan gives Sean 8.0 more apples, so now Sean has 9.0 + 8.0 = 17.0 apples.Step 3: Sean buys 18.0 tickets at the store, which has no bearing on the number of apples he has. Therefore, Sean still has 17.0 apples in the end.QED!"

question: If Anne wandered for 3.0 hours at 2.0 miles per hour . How far did Anne go ?
golden answer: 6.0
held-out prompt: "Like an athlete training for an event, every exercise has a purpose: "
prompted answer: If Anne wandered for 3.0 hours at 2.0 miles per hour . How far did Anne go ?"Like an athlete training for an event, every exercise has a purpose: "Anne wandered" means that she was not following a specific route or schedule, but rather moving around freely. The distance she traveled can be calculated by multiplying the time she wandered by her speed: distance = time x speed. In this case, Anne wandered for 3.0 hours, so the distance she traveled is: distance = 3.0 hours x 2.0 miles/hour = 6.0 miles. So, Anne went 6.0 miles while wandering.

prompted answer: There are 36.0 students trying out for the school 's trivia teams . If 9.0 of them did n't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 3.0 groups , how many students would be in each group ?"This is like tuning an instrument. Every adjustment leads to harmony: " said the teacher as she divided the students into groups. "Let's see how many students are in each group." She looked at her notes and continued, "If 9.0 students didn't get picked for the team, that means there are 36.0 - 9.0 = 27.0 students left. Since there are 3.0 groups, we can divide 27.0 by 3.0 to find out how many students are in each group. "27.0 ÷ 3.0 = 9.0 students in each group."The students cheered and clapped as they found out they would be in smaller groups. The teacher smiled and said, "Great job! Now, let's get started on our next challenge."
