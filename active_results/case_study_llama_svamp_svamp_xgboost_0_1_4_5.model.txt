prompted answer: nell collects cards . she had 246 baseball cards and 214 10 cards . she gave some of her cards to jeff and now has 404 baseball cards and 495 10 cards left . how many more 10 cards than baseball cards does nell have ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
Ð‰ Nell has 404 baseball cards and 495 10 cards. "
Step 1: We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 10 cards initially.
Step 2: We are given that she gave some of her cards to Jeff.
Step 3: We know that Nell now has 404 baseball cards and 495 10 cards.
Step 4: We want to find out how many more 10 cards than baseball cards Nell has.
So, let's subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of cards:
495 (10 cards) - 404 (baseball cards) = 91
Therefore, Nell has 91 more 10 cards than baseball cards.
So, the answer is 91.

prompted answer: faye had 31 packs of pencils each one having 6 pencils . she was placing her pencils into rows with 19 pencils in each row . how many pencils does she have ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "1.
Step 1: Understand the problem statement. We are given that Faye has 31 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 6 pencils. We are also told that Faye is placing her pencils into rows, with 19 pencils in each row.
Step 2: Identify the relevant information. We know that Faye has 31 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 6 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils Faye has is:
31 packs x 6 pencils per pack = 186 pencils
We also know that Faye is placing her pencils into rows, with 19 pencils in each row. So, the total number of rows of pencils Faye has is:
186 pencils / 19 pencils per row = 9 rows of pencils
Step 3: Conclude the answer. Therefore, Faye has 9 rows of pencils, with 19 pencils in each row. In total, Faye has 186 pencils.

question: Kaleb had 10.0 video games but 8.0 of them were n't working . If he wanted to sell the working games for $ 6.0 each , how much money could he earn ?
golden answer: 12.0

prompted answer: Kaleb had 10.0 video games but 8.0 of them were n't working . If he wanted to sell the working games for $ 6.0 each , how much money could he earn ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "The problem states that Kaleb has 10.0 video games but 8.0 of them are not working. We are asked to find out how much money Kaleb could earn if he sells the working games for $6.0 each.
Step 1: Identify the number of working video games that Kaleb has.
From the problem, we know that 8.0 of Kaleb's video games are not working, which means that the number of working video games he has is 10.0 - 8.0 = 2.0.
Step 2: Find out how much money Kaleb could earn from selling the working video games.
If Kaleb sells each of his 2.0 working video games for $6.0, he will earn a total of 2.0 x $6.0 = $12.0.
Therefore, Kaleb could earn $12.0 by selling the working video games.
Conclusion: Kaleb could earn $12.0 by selling the working video games."
