To determine how many weeks it will take him to finish the series, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books he reads each week.
So, in this case, if Roger reads 6 books each week, it will take him:
30 books / 6 books per week = 5 weeks
Therefore, it will take Roger 5 weeks to finish reading his entire book series."

prompted answer: jake has 18 fewer peaches than steven who has 13 more peaches than jill . steven has 19 peaches . how many peaches does jill have ?"As a cartographer maps terrains, let's chart the nuances and details: "Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 13 more peaches than Jill.
Jill has 19 peaches.
To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided to find the number of peaches Jill has.
Let's start by using the information that Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven. This means that if Steven has x peaches, Jake has x - 18 peaches.
Next, we know that Steven has 13 more peaches than Jill. This means that if Jill has x peaches, Steven has x + 13 peaches.
Now, we are told that Steven has 19 peaches. So, we can set up the equation:
x + 13 = 19
To solve for x (Jill's peaches), we can subtract 13 from both sides of the equation:
x = 6
So, Jill has 6 peaches.
Therefore, the answer is 6."

To determine how many more books than movies are in the series, we need to calculate the difference between the number of books and movies.
Books: 16 (as you mentioned)
Movies: 14 (as you mentioned)
So, the difference between the number of books and movies is:
16 - 14 = 2
Therefore, there are 2 more books than movies in the "Crazy Silly School" series.

This statement implies that the shop sells t-shirts with a fixed price of $106 each.
"During the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game, they sold a total of 242 t-shirts." This statement reveals that the shop sold t-shirts during both the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game.
"If they sold 115 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, how many t-shirts did they sell during the Texas Tech game?" This question seeks to determine the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game based on the information provided.
To solve this problem, we can use the information provided in the statements:
Let X be the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game.
From the first statement, we know that the razorback t-shirt shop makes $106 dollars off each t-shirt sold. Therefore, the total revenue generated from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game is:
Revenue = Number of t-shirts sold x $106 dollars per t-shirt
We are given that the total number of t-shirts sold during both games is 242. Therefore, the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game is:
X = 242 - 115
X = 127 t-shirts
Therefore, the razorback t-shirt shop sold 127 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

She was making bouquets with 8.0 flowers in each one. If 47.0 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?"To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of flowers Wendy had by the number that remained after 47.0 flowers wilted.So, the total number of flowers Wendy had is 103.0.

They have 350 balls in total and want to repaint them in 10 different colors. If they painted an equal number of balls for every color, how many balls are there for each color?
Let's break this down:
1. Total number of balls: 350
2. Number of colors: 10
3. Equal number of balls for each color: Let's assume x balls are painted in each color.
So, the number of balls in each color is x.
Now, we can use the distributive property to find the total number of balls in each color:
Total number of balls in each color = Number of balls in each color x Total number of balls
= x x 350
= 350x

So, there are 350x balls in each color.
Now, we can find the value of x by dividing the total number of balls by the number of colors:
x = 350 / 10
= 35

So, there are 35 balls in each color."
