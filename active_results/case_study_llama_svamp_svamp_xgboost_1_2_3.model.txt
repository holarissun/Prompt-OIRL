prompted answer: a mailman has to give out 192 pieces of junk mail . if he goes to 4 blocks how many pieces of junk mail should he give each block ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "A mailman has to deliver 192 pieces of junk mail.
To determine how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give to each block, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of blocks he needs to deliver to.
Let's assume the mailman needs to deliver the junk mail to 4 blocks.
So, to calculate the number of pieces of junk mail each block should receive, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail (192) by the number of blocks (4):
192 รท 4 = 48
So, each block should receive 48 pieces of junk mail.

prompted answer: a chef used 39 cherries to make a pie . now he has 58 cherries left . how many cherries did he have before he made the pie ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Before Making the Pie" = 39 cherries"After Making the Pie" = 58 cherriesNow, let's solve the problem:Before making the pie, the chef had 39 cherries.
Let's assume the chef had x cherries before making the pie.
After making the pie, the chef has 58 cherries left.
So, the difference between the number of cherries the chef had before making the pie and the number of cherries he has after making the pie is:
x - 58 = 39
Now, we can solve for x:
x = 97
So, the chef had 97 cherries before making the pie.

prompted answer: rachel picked 7 ripe apples from her tree . now the tree has 5 apples still on it . if 3 of those are ripe and the rest are unripe how many unripe apples does the tree have now ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Rachel picked 7 ripe apples from her tree." - This statement tells us that Rachel picked a certain number of apples from her tree, and we know that they were ripe because it specifies that they were ripe.
"Now the tree has 5 apples still on it." - This statement tells us that after Rachel picked the 7 ripe apples, there are still 5 apples left on the tree.
"If 3 of those are ripe and the rest are unripe, how many unripe apples does the tree have now?" - This question asks us to determine the number of unripe apples on the tree after Rachel picked the 7 ripe ones.
So, to answer the question, we need to find out how many apples are left on the tree after Rachel picked the 7 ripe ones. We know that 5 apples are left on the tree, and we are told that 3 of them are ripe. That means that 2 apples are unripe.
Therefore, the tree has 2 unripe apples left.

* Number of crayons Paul had left at the end of the school year: 391
Erasers:
* Number of erasers Paul received: 38
* Number of erasers Paul had left at the end of the school year: 38
Now, let's find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left:
Number of crayons Paul had left = 391
Number of erasers Paul had left = 38
To find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left, we need to subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons:
391 - 38 = 353
So, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers left at the end of the school year.
