prompted answer: There are 97.0 erasers in a box . Ernest has 17.0 erasers in a bag . Mark takes 97.0 erasers out of the box . How many erasers are left in the box ?"This is like a pot of stew, simmering to meld the flavors: "There are 97.0 erasers in a box. Ernest has 17.0 erasers in a bag. Mark takes 97.0 erasers out of the box. How many erasers are left in the box?"
Answer:
There are 79.0 erasers left in the box.
Explanation:
To find the number of erasers left in the box, we need to subtract the number of erasers taken by Mark from the total number of erasers in the box.
97.0 erasers in the box - 97.0 erasers taken by Mark = 0 erasers left in the box
So, there are 0 erasers left in the box.

Answer:
Jeremy strolled for 10 hours.

Explanation:
To find out how long Jeremy strolled, we need to multiply the distance he traveled (20.0 kilometers) by the speed at which he traveled (2.0 kilometers per hour).
20.0 kilometers x 2.0 kilometers per hour = 40.0 hours
Since there are 1000 meters in 1 kilometer, we can convert the distance traveled from kilometers to meters:
20.0 kilometers x 1000 meters/kilometer = 20,000 meters
Now, we can divide the distance traveled (20,000 meters) by the speed at which Jeremy traveled (2.0 kilometers per hour) to find out how long he strolled:
20,000 meters รท 2.0 kilometers per hour = 10 hours
Therefore, Jeremy strolled for 10 hours.

prompted answer: Todd has some gum . Steve gave him 16.0 more pieces of gum . Now Todd has 54.0 pieces of gum . How many pieces did Todd have to start with ?"This is like a pot of stew, simmering to meld the flavors: "Todd has some gum. Steve gave him 16.0 more pieces of gum. Now Todd has 54.0 pieces of gum. How many pieces did Todd have to start with?"
To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the passage. We know that Todd had some gum to start with, and Steve gave him 16 more pieces of gum. So, the total number of pieces of gum Todd had is:
Todd's gum = some gum + 16.0 more pieces of gum
We are also told that Todd now has 54 pieces of gum. So, we can set up the equation:
Todd's gum = some gum + 16.0 more pieces of gum = 54.0 pieces of gum
Now, we can solve for the value of "some gum" by subtracting 16.0 from both sides of the equation:
Todd's gum = some gum + 16.0 more pieces of gum = 54.0 pieces of gum
Subtracting 16.0 from both sides gives us:
Todd's gum = some gum
So, Todd had 38 pieces of gum to start with.

This is the starting point, the foundation of the problem. "He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove, baseball, and bat." This is the additional information that we need to use to solve the problem. "He had 32.0 dollars over." This is the remaining amount of money that Benny has after buying the baseball gear.So, to find out how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we need to subtract the amount he had over from the total amount he received for his birthday: 79.0 - 32.0 = 47.0 dollars.So, Benny spent 47.0 dollars on the baseball gear.

prompted answer: How many yards of material from a 24.0 yard length of cloth remains after 3.0 pieces each 3.5 yards long and 5.0 pieces each 2.25 long are removed ?"As a cartographer maps terrains, let's chart the nuances and details: "The length of cloth is 24.0 yards, and the number of pieces to be cut is 3 + 5 = 8 pieces. Each piece is 3.5 yards long, so the total length of the pieces is 8 x 3.5 = 28 yards. Since 28 yards is less than 24 yards, there will be some remaining length of cloth after the pieces are cut. To find the remaining length, we subtract the total length of the pieces from the length of the cloth: 24.0 - 28 = -4 yards. Therefore, 3.0 yards of material from a 24.0 yard length of cloth remains after 3.0 pieces each 3.5 yards long and 5.0 pieces each 2.25 long are removed."

He has already cooked 7.0. If each potato takes 3.0 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?"
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many potatoes the chef has left to cook. We can do this by subtracting the number of potatoes he has already cooked (7.0) from the total number of potatoes he needs to cook (9.0):
9.0 - 7.0 = 2.0
So, the chef has 2.0 potatoes left to cook. If each potato takes 3.0 minutes to cook, it will take him 6.0 minutes (2.0 x 3.0) to cook the remaining potatoes.
Therefore, the answer is 6.0 minutes.
