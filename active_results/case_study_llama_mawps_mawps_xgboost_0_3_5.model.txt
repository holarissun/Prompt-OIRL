prompted answer: Megan had 40.0 homework problems . She finished 26.0 of them but still had 2.0 pages of problems to do . If each page has the same number of problems on it , how many problems are on each page ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Megan had 40.0 homework problems. She finished 26.0 of them, but still had 2.0 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?"
To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the passage. We know that Megan had 40.0 homework problems and that she finished 26.0 of them. This means that she still has 14.0 problems left to do.
We are also told that she has 2.0 pages of problems to do. Since each page has the same number of problems, we can divide the number of problems she has left to do by the number of pages she has to find out how many problems are on each page:
14.0 problems รท 2.0 pages = 7.0 problems per page
So, there are 7.0 problems on each page.

If 9.0 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 3.0 groups, how many students would be in each group?"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how many students will be in each group. We can do this by dividing the total number of students who didn't get picked for the team by the number of groups available.So, if there are 36.0 students trying out for the school's trivia teams and 9.0 of them didn't get picked for the team, then the total number of students who didn't get picked for the team is 36.0 - 9.0 = 27.0 students.Now, we need to divide the number of students who didn't get picked for the team by the number of groups available, which is 3.0 groups. So, we can divide 27.0 by 3.0 to get the number of students in each group:27.0 รท 3.0 = 9.0 students in each groupTherefore, there will be 9.0 students in each group.

How many inches of the road had they repaved before today ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Repaving a road" is the context, and "inches" is the unit of measurement.So, the information we have is:
Context: Repaving a road
Unit of measurement: Inches
Information given:

* Total inches repaved so far: 4938.0 inches
* Total inches repaved today: 805.0 inches

Now, to find out how many inches of the road had been repaved before today, we can subtract the total inches repaved today from the total inches repaved so far:
4938.0 inches - 805.0 inches = 4133.0 inches

Therefore, before today, the construction company had repaved 4133.0 inches of the road.

prompted answer: A teacher had 6.0 worksheets to grade . If she graded 4.0 , but then another 18.0 were turned in , how many worksheets would she have to grade ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "A teacher had 6.0 worksheets to grade. If she graded 4.0, but then another 18.0 were turned in, how many worksheets would she have to grade?"
To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of worksheets the teacher had initially (6.0) and the number of worksheets she graded initially (4.0).
So, the difference is: 6.0 - 4.0 = 2.0
Now, we need to add the number of worksheets that were turned in later (18.0) to the total number of worksheets the teacher had to grade:
2.0 + 18.0 = 20.0
Therefore, the teacher would have to grade 20.0 worksheets in total.
