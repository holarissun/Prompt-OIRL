prompted answer: There are 16.0 bottle caps in a box . Marvin takes 6.0 bottle caps . How many are left ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Marvin takes 6.0 bottle caps" can be categorized under "Information about Marvin" since it is a statement about Marvin's actions or characteristics. "There are 16.0 bottle caps in a box" can be categorized under "Information about the box" since it is a statement about the quantity of bottle caps in a single box.Now, let's apply the categorization to the problem:
Information about Marvin: Marvin takes 6.0 bottle caps.
Information about the box: There are 16.0 bottle caps in a box.
To find out how many bottle caps are left, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps taken by Marvin from the total number of bottle caps in the box:
16.0 - 6.0 = 10.0
So, there are 10.0 bottle caps left in the box.

prompted answer: Joe had 50.0 toy cars . If he gets 12.0 more cars , how many cars will he have then ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Toy Cars" is the category, and "Number of Cars" is the subcategory. So, the problem can be represented as:
Toy Cars: 50.0
Number of Cars: 50.0 + 12.0 = 62.0
Therefore, if Joe gets 12 more toy cars, he will have 62 toy cars in total.
