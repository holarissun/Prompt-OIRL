prompted answer: nell collects cards . she had 246 baseball cards and 214 10 cards . she gave some of her cards to jeff and now has 404 baseball cards and 495 10 cards left . how many more 10 cards than baseball cards does nell have ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
Ð‰ Nell has 404 baseball cards and 495 10 cards. "
Step 1: We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 10 cards initially.
Step 2: We are given that she gave some of her cards to Jeff.
Step 3: We know that Nell now has 404 baseball cards and 495 10 cards.
Step 4: We want to find out how many more 10 cards than baseball cards Nell has.
So, let's subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of cards:
495 (10 cards) - 404 (baseball cards) = 91
Therefore, Nell has 91 more 10 cards than baseball cards.
So, the answer is 91.

prompted answer: A store had 34.0 oranges in a bin . If they threw away 20.0 of the old ones and put 13.0 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "The number of oranges in the bin before the store threw away 20.0 old ones is 34.0. "Now, we know that the store threw away 20.0 old oranges, so the number of oranges in the bin after that is:34.0 - 20.0 = 14.0 oranges in the bin after the store threw away 20.0 old ones. "Now, we know that the store put 13.0 new oranges in the bin, so the number of oranges in the bin after both actions is:14.0 + 13.0 = 27.0 oranges in the bin after the store threw away 20.0 old ones and put 13.0 new ones in the bin.Therefore, there are 27.0 oranges in the bin.

held-out prompt: "Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
prompted answer: Michelle began her pizza delivery route with 0.5 tank of gas in her car . When she made it back to the pizzeria , 0.16666666666666666 tank of gas was . How much gas did Michelle use ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "The problem states that Michelle began her pizza delivery route with 0.5 tank of gas in her car. Let's assume that the volume of gas in the tank is represented by the variable x. Therefore, the total volume of gas in the tank at the beginning of the route is 0.5x.Now, we are told that when Michelle made it back to the pizzeria, 0.16666666666666666 tank of gas was left in the tank. This means that the volume of gas left in the tank is 0.16666666666666666x.Now, we need to find out how much gas Michelle used during the route. To do this, we need to subtract the volume of gas left in the tank from the total volume of gas in the tank at the beginning of the route. Therefore, the amount of gas used by Michelle during the route is:0.5x - 0.16666666666666666x = 0.3333333333333333x = 0.3333333333333333 gallonsSo, Michelle used approximately 0.3333333333333333 gallons of gas during her pizza delivery route."

question: Paige and her friends were recycling paper for their class . For every 4.0 pounds they recycled they earned one point . If Paige recycled 14.0 pounds and her friends recycled 2.0 pounds , how many points did they earn ?
golden answer: 4.0
held-out prompt: "Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
prompted answer: Paige and her friends were recycling paper for their class . For every 4.0 pounds they recycled they earned one point . If Paige recycled 14.0 pounds and her friends recycled 2.0 pounds , how many points did they earn ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
Step 1: Write the problem as an equation.
Let's say Paige recycled x pounds of paper.
For every 4.0 pounds of paper recycled, Paige and her friends earn 1 point.
So, the points earned by Paige and her friends is equal to x / 4.0.
Step 2: Use the information given in the problem to find the value of x.
We know that Paige recycled 14.0 pounds of paper and her friends recycled 2.0 pounds of paper.
So, the total amount of paper recycled by Paige and her friends is 14.0 + 2.0 = 16.0 pounds.
Step 3: Use the equation from step 1 to find the points earned by Paige and her friends.
Points earned = x / 4.0
Since the total amount of paper recycled is 16.0 pounds, we can find the value of x by dividing 16.0 by 4.0:
x = 16.0 / 4.0 = 4.0
So, Paige and her friends earned 4 points for recycling 16.0 pounds of paper.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 4 points.

question: Melanie , Benny , Sandy , and Jessica each have 9.0 dozen Pokemon cards . How many Pokemon cards do they have in all ?
golden answer: 432.0
held-out prompt: "Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
prompted answer: Melanie , Benny , Sandy , and Jessica each have 9.0 dozen Pokemon cards . How many Pokemon cards do they have in all ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "Step 1: Identify the given information. We are given that Melanie has 9.0 dozen Pokemon cards, Benny has 9.0 dozen Pokemon cards, Sandy has 9.0 dozen Pokemon cards, and Jessica has 9.0 dozen Pokemon cards. In total, they have 9.0 x 4 = 36.0 dozen Pokemon cards.Step 2: Determine the total number of Pokemon cards. Since each dozen contains 12 cards, the total number of Pokemon cards is 36.0 x 12 = 432.So, Melanie, Benny, Sandy, and Jessica have 432 Pokemon cards in all."

question: mark has 13 trees in his backyard . if he plants 12 more how many trees will he have ?
golden answer: 25.0
held-out prompt: "Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
prompted answer: mark has 13 trees in his backyard . if he plants 12 more how many trees will he have ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "The problem states that the man has 13 trees in his backyard.
Step 1: Let X be the number of trees the man has in his backyard initially.
Step 2: The problem states that the man plants 12 more trees.
Step 3: Let Y be the number of trees the man has after planting 12 more trees.
Step 4: We are asked how many trees the man will have if he plants 12 more trees.
Step 5: Using the information provided in the problem, we can write an equation:
X + 12 = Y
Step 6: Solving for Y, we get:
Y = X + 12
Step 7: Now we can find the number of trees the man will have after planting 12 more trees:
Y = X + 12
Substituting X = 13 (the number of trees the man already has):
Y = 13 + 12
Y = 25
Therefore, the man will have 25 trees in his backyard after planting 12 more trees.
So, the answer to the question is 25 trees."
In summary, the man will have 25 trees in his backyard after planting 12 more trees, because initially he had 13 trees and he added 12 more, for a total of 25 trees.

question: arthur baked 35 muffins . how many more muffins does arthur have to bake to have 83 muffins ?
golden answer: 48.0
held-out prompt: "Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
prompted answer: arthur baked 35 muffins . how many more muffins does arthur have to bake to have 83 muffins ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "Arthur baked 35 muffins." (Assumption 1) "Arthur has 83 muffins in total." (Assumption 2)Now, we need to find out how many more muffins Arthur has to bake to have 83 muffins.
Step 1: Subtract the number of muffins Arthur already has from the total number of muffins he needs.
83 - 35 = 48
So, Arthur has to bake 48 more muffins to have 83 muffins in total.
Therefore, the answer is 48 more muffins.
