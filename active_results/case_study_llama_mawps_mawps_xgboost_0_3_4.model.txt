prompted answer: Kimberly has 5.0 Skittles . She buys 7.0 more . Later , Kimberly buys 18.0 oranges at the store . How many Skittles does Kimberly have in all ?"Imagine it as an echo in a valley, every sound has an origin and meaning: "Kimberly has 5.0 Skittles. She buys 7.0 more." The sound of the word "Skittles" echoes in the valley, and the meaning of the sentence is clear: Kimberly has 5.0 Skittles initially. "Later, Kimberly buys 18.0 oranges at the store." The sound of the word "oranges" echoes in the valley, and the meaning of the sentence is clear: Kimberly buys 18.0 oranges at the store later. "How many Skittles does Kimberly have in all?"

If he spent 11.0 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 2.0 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?""
Answer:
Frank has 8.0 dollars left after buying new mower blades.
To find out how many 2.0 dollar games Frank could buy with the money he has left, we divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game:
8.0 dollars รท 2.0 dollars = 4 games
So Frank could buy 4 games with the money he has left.

Answer:
Mike has 69.0 - 24.0 = 45.0 dollars left after buying new mower blades.
To find out how many 5.0 dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left, we divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game:
45.0 dollars / 5.0 dollars = 9 games
So Mike can buy 9 games with the money he has left.

Answer:
The third friend owns 0.25 of the car.

Explanation:

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* The first friend owns 0.5833 of the car.
* The second friend owns 0.1667 of the car.
* The third friend owns x of the car.

We know that the total value of the car is 1, so the sum of the fractions owned by all three friends must equal 1:

0.5833 + 0.1667 + x = 1

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 0.25

Therefore, the third friend owns 0.25 of the car.

She was making bouquets with 8.0 flowers in each one, a delicate balance of form and function. But then, the unthinkable happened. 47.0 of the flowers wilted, leaving only 56.0 left to work with. The echoes of the valley whisper the question again: How many bouquets could Wendy still make?The answer is not as straightforward as it seems. To find out, we must divide the remaining flowers by the number of bouquets she wanted to make. 56.0 flowers / 8.0 bouquets per flower = 7.0 bouquets left to make.The echoes of the valley are quiet for a moment, as if they are digesting the answer. And then, they speak again, with a newfound understanding: Wendy could still make 7.0 bouquets, a testament to her skill and dedication. The valley is filled with the sweet scent of flowers, and the sound of Wendy's laughter, as she works her magic once again."

Answer: Tim has 12.0 nickels now.

Since nickels are worth 5 cents each, Tim now has 12.0 nickels (7.0 x 5 cents = 35 cents + 5.0 x 5 cents = 25 cents = 12.0 nickels).
