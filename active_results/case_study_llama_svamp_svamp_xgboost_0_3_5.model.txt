To determine how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give to each block, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of blocks he needs to deliver to.
Let's assume the mailman needs to deliver the junk mail to 4 blocks.
So, to calculate the number of pieces of junk mail each block should receive, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail (192) by the number of blocks (4):
192 รท 4 = 48
So, each block should receive 48 pieces of junk mail.

New storks: 2
So, the total number of storks sitting on the fence after the new ones arrived is:
Storks: 3 + 2 = 5
Now, let's find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence:
Birds: 6 - 5 = 1

It does not provide any information about the age or condition of the oranges. "If they threw away 40.0 of the old ones and put 24.0 new ones in the bin."This statement is also a factual statement about the quantity of oranges in the bin, but it provides additional information about the number of oranges that were thrown away and the number of new oranges that were added to the bin. "How many would be in the bin?"This is a question asking for an estimate or calculation of the total number of oranges in the bin after the old ones were thrown away and the new ones were added.To answer this question, we need to use the information provided in the passage: "A store had 50.0 oranges in a bin."So, the total number of oranges in the bin before any were thrown away or added is 50.0.Then, we are told that 40.0 of the old oranges were thrown away, leaving 10.0 oranges in the bin.Additionally, 24.0 new oranges were added to the bin, bringing the total number of oranges in the bin to 10.0 + 24.0 = 34.0 oranges.Therefore, there would be 34.0 oranges in the bin after the old ones were thrown away and the new ones were added.
