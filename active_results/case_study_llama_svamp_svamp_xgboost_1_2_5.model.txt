prompted answer: while shopping maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels . if she gave her mother 34 of them how many towels did maria end up with ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels." (Assumption 1) "Maria gave her mother 34 of them." (Assumption 2)Now, let's use the information given in the problem to find out how many towels Maria ended up with:Total number of towels = Number of green towels + Number of white towels = 35 + 21 = 56Now, we are given that Maria gave her mother 34 towels, so the number of towels Maria ended up with is:Number of towels Maria ended up with = Total number of towels - Number of towels given to mother = 56 - 34 = 22Therefore, Maria ended up with 22 towels."

Zoe bought an app that cost $5 dollars.
Each month, Zoe has to pay $8 to play the game online.
Step 2: Let's find out how many months Zoe played the game online.
If Zoe played the game online for 2 months, then the number of months she played the game online is 2.
Step 3: Let's find out how much money Zoe spent on the app and online access.
Since Zoe played the game online for 2 months, she spent $8 x 2 = $16 on online access.
Adding the cost of the app ($5) to the amount she spent on online access ($16), we get: $5 + $16 = $21.
Therefore, Zoe spent a total of $21 on the app and online access.

prompted answer: jerry had 3 action figures on a shelf in his room . later he added 4 more action figures to the shelf and removed some of the old ones . if there are 6 action figures on his shelf now how many action figures did he remove from the shelf ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: " Jerry had 3 action figures on a shelf in his room.
Step 1: Jerry added 4 more action figures to the shelf.
So, the total number of action figures on the shelf now is 3 + 4 = 7.
Step 2: Jerry removed some of the old action figures from the shelf.
We are told that Jerry removed some of the old action figures from the shelf, but we are not given the exact number of action figures he removed.
Step 3: We want to find out how many action figures Jerry removed from the shelf.
Since Jerry had 3 action figures on the shelf initially, and he removed some of them, the number of action figures he removed must be equal to the number of action figures he had initially minus the number of action figures he added to the shelf.
So, the number of action figures Jerry removed from the shelf is: 3 - 4 = -1.
Therefore, Jerry removed 1 action figure from the shelf.
Conclusion: Jerry removed 1 action figure from the shelf.

question: the razorback shop makes $ 115 dollars off each jersey and $ 25 off each t-shirt . during the arkansas and texas tech game they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys . how much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt ?

prompted answer: the razorback shop makes $ 115 dollars off each jersey and $ 25 off each t-shirt . during the arkansas and texas tech game they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys . how much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "The razorback shop makes $115 for each jersey and $25 for each t-shirt."Let's assume that the number of jerseys sold is x.
We know that the total revenue from jerseys is $115x.
The total revenue from t-shirts is $25(113) = $2775.
So, the total revenue from both jerseys and t-shirts is $115x + $2775 = $2990.
Now, we want to find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt. Let's call the difference between the cost of a jersey and a t-shirt, "d".
We know that d is greater than 0 because the razorback shop makes more money from jerseys than from t-shirts.
We can set up the equation:
d = $115 - $25
d = $90
So, a jersey costs $90 more than a t-shirt.
Therefore, the answer is $90.

question: faye had 35 packs of pencils each one having 4 pencils . she was placing her pencils into rows with 2 pencils in each row . how many rows could she make ?
golden answer: 70.0
held-out prompt: "Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
prompted answer: faye had 35 packs of pencils each one having 4 pencils . she was placing her pencils into rows with 2 pencils in each row . how many rows could she make ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "1.
Step 1: Understand the problem statement. We are given that Faye has 35 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 4 pencils. We are also told that Faye is placing her pencils into rows with 2 pencils in each row.
Step 2: Define the variables. Let's define the number of rows Faye can make as "r".
Step 3: Use the information given in the problem to find the total number of pencils Faye has. Since Faye has 35 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 4 pencils, the total number of pencils Faye has is:
35 packs x 4 pencils/pack = 140 pencils
Step 4: Find the ratio of the number of pencils in each row to the total number of pencils Faye has. Since Faye is placing her pencils into rows with 2 pencils in each row, the ratio of the number of pencils in each row to the total number of pencils Faye has is:
2 pencils/row / 140 pencils = 1/70
Step 5: Use the ratio to find the number of rows Faye can make. Since Faye has 140 pencils and she wants to place them into rows with 2 pencils in each row, the number of rows Faye can make is:
140 pencils / 2 pencils/row = 70 rows
Therefore, Faye can make 70 rows of pencils.

prompted answer: For Halloween Janet and her sister combined the candy they received . Janet had 34.0 pieces of candy while her sister had 33.0 . If they ate 4.0 pieces the first night , how many pieces do they have left ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
Let Janet have x pieces of candy. Since her sister had 33.0 pieces of candy, the total number of pieces of candy they received is 34.0 + 33.0 = 67.0 pieces.
If they ate 4.0 pieces on the first night, then the number of pieces of candy they have left is:
x - 4 = 67.0
Now we can solve for x, the number of pieces of candy Janet has left:
x = 67.0 - 4 = 63.0
So Janet has 63.0 pieces of candy left."
Answer: Janet has 63.0 pieces of candy left.
