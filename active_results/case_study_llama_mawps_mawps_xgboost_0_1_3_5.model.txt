prompted answer: Megan had 40.0 homework problems . She finished 26.0 of them but still had 2.0 pages of problems to do . If each page has the same number of problems on it , how many problems are on each page ?"As a cartographer maps terrains, let's chart the nuances and details: "How many problems are on each page?" we ask. Megan has 40.0 homework problems, and she finished 26.0 of them. That means she has 14.0 problems left to do. Since each page has the same number of problems, we can divide the remaining problems by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page. In this case, dividing 14.0 problems by 2.0 pages gives us 7.0 problems per page. So, there are 7.0 problems on each page.

prompted answer: Jeremy strolled 20.0 kilometers at 2.0 kilometers per hour . How long did Jeremy stroll ?"It's like sifting for gold, discarding the dirt to find the nuggets: " Jeremy strolled for 10.0 hours.
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time. In this case, the distance traveled by Jeremy is 20.0 kilometers, and his speed is 2.0 kilometers per hour. Therefore, we can plug these values into the formula to find the time it took him to stroll:
distance = speed x time
20.0 km = 2.0 km/h x time
time = distance / speed
time = 20.0 km / 2.0 km/h
time = 10.0 hours

Therefore, Jeremy strolled for 10.0 hours.

This is the given information we will work with. To solve the problem, we need to find out how many songs Zoe has on her mp3 player after she deleted 8.0 old songs and added 50.0 new songs.
Deleting 8.0 old songs:
Let's subtract 8.0 from 15.0 to find out how many songs Zoe had after deleting the old songs:
15.0 - 8.0 = 7.0
So, Zoe had 7.0 songs on her mp3 player after deleting 8.0 old songs.
Adding 50.0 new songs:
Let's add 50.0 to 7.0 to find out how many songs Zoe has on her mp3 player now:
7.0 + 50.0 = 57.0
So, Zoe has 57.0 songs on her mp3 player after adding 50.0 new songs.
Therefore, the answer is 57.0 songs.
