prompted answer: Megan had 40.0 homework problems . She finished 26.0 of them but still had 2.0 pages of problems to do . If each page has the same number of problems on it , how many problems are on each page ?"As a photographer captures moments, let's focus on each element: "If each page has the same number of problems on it."In this case, we know that Megan finished 26.0 of the 40.0 homework problems, which means she still has 14.0 problems to complete. Since each page has the same number of problems, we can divide the remaining problems by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page:14.0 problems / 2.0 pages = 7.0 problems per pageSo, there are 7.0 problems on each page.

prompted answer: A chef needs to cook 15.0 potatoes . He has already cooked 8.0 . If each potato takes 9.0 minutes to cook , how long will it take him to cook the rest ?"As a detective collecting clues for a case, let's unravel the mystery: "A chef needs to cook 15.0 potatoes. He has already cooked 8.0 potatoes. If each potato takes 9.0 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the total number of potatoes the chef needs to cook and the number of potatoes he has already cooked.In this case, the total number of potatoes the chef needs to cook is 15.0 - 8.0 = 7.0 potatoes.Now, we need to find out how long it will take the chef to cook 7.0 potatoes. We know that each potato takes 9.0 minutes to cook, so the chef will need to cook 7.0 x 9.0 = 63.0 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.Therefore, it will take the chef 63.0 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

For how much should the dealer sell the car ?"Imagine this as a marathon; every mile, every step takes us closer to the finish: "the solution to this problem. Let's start by identifying the variables we have: Selling price of the car (SP) = 6000.0 dollars Profit percentage (P) = 25.0% Now, we need to find the value of SP that will give us the desired profit. To do this, we can use the formula: SP = SP x (1 + P) = 6000 x (1 + 0.25) = 6000 x 1.25 = 7500.0 dollars So, the dealer should sell the car for $7500 to make a profit of $2500 (25.0% of $7500)."

Let's set up: "If 49.0 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?"
We know that the total number of customers the waiter had to wait on was 39.0 + 12.0 = 51.0 customers.
We are told that 49.0 of these customers did not leave a tip.
So, the number of customers who did leave a tip is:
51.0 - 49.0 = 2.0 customers
Therefore, 2 customers left a tip.

prompted answer: If Karen sold 36.0 boxes of Tagalongs , how many cases of 12.0 boxes does Karen pickup from the cookie mom ?"As a cartographer maps terrains, let's chart the nuances and details: "Karen sold 36.0 boxes of Tagalongs" implies that Karen sold a total of 36 boxes of Tagalongs. To find out how many cases of 12.0 boxes Karen picks up from the Cookie Mom, we need to divide the number of boxes Karen sold by the number of boxes in a case. Since there are 12.0 boxes in a case, we can calculate the number of cases Karen picks up as follows:
36.0 boxes / 12.0 boxes per case = 3 cases
Therefore, Karen picks up 3 cases of Tagalongs from the Cookie Mom.

If she finished 24.0 of the problems at school, how many problems did she have to do for homework?".
To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of problems Gwen finished at school from the total number of problems she had for homework.
18.0 + 11.0 = 29.0

To estimate the number of infected PCs on the LAN, we can use the proportion of infected PCs in the sample. The proportion of infected PCs in the sample is 7/12, or 0.58. To estimate the number of infected PCs, we multiply the proportion by the total number of PCs: 0.58 x 216 = 126. So, there are approximately 126 infected PCs on the LAN.

Layer by layer, we analyze: "Connie had some marbles. She gave 183.0 to Juan. Now she has 593.0 marbles left. How many did she have to start with?"We can start by using the information given in the problem to create a equation. Let's say Connie had x marbles to start with. Then, she gave 183.0 marbles to Juan, so she has x - 183.0 marbles left.Now, we are told that Connie has 593.0 marbles left. So, we can set up the equation:x - 183.0 = 593.0Now, we can solve for x by adding 183.0 to both sides of the equation:x = 593.0 + 183.0 = 776.0So, Connie had 776.0 marbles to start with.

"Now she has 38.0 trucks left." Let's solve for the missing value: Sarah had x trucks to start with. Since Sarah gave 13.0 trucks to Jeff, she has x - 13.0 trucks left.
