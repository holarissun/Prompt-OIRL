prompted answer: Sally had 8.0 pennies and 7.0 nickels in her bank . Her dad gave her 9.0 nickels and her mother gave her 2.0 nickels . How many nickels does Sally have now ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Pennies" and "Nickels" are the two categories.
Sally had 8.0 pennies and 7.0 nickels in her bank initially, so the total amount of money she had was 8.0 + 7.0 = 15.0.
Now, her dad gave her 9.0 nickels, so the new total amount of nickels she has is 7.0 + 9.0 = 16.0.
Her mother gave her 2.0 nickels, so the new total amount of nickels she has is 16.0 + 2.0 = 18.0.
Therefore, Sally has 18.0 nickels in her bank now.
