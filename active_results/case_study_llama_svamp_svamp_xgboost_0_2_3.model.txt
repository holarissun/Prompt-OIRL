To determine how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give to each block, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of blocks he needs to deliver to.
Let's assume the mailman needs to deliver the junk mail to 4 blocks.
So, to calculate the number of pieces of junk mail each block should receive, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail (192) by the number of blocks (4):
192 รท 4 = 48
So, each block should receive 48 pieces of junk mail.

"David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary."This information tells us the difference between the number of push-ups David did and Zachary did.
So, to find out how many push-ups Zachary did, we subtract the number of push-ups David did from the total number of push-ups David and Zachary did:
Zachary did 51 - 49 = 2 push-ups.
Therefore, David and Zachary did altogether 51 + 2 = 53 push-ups in gym class today.

Crayons:
* Number of crayons Paul received: 531
* Number of crayons Paul had left at the end of the school year: 391
Erasers:
* Number of erasers Paul received: 38
* Number of erasers Paul had left at the end of the school year: 38
Now, let's find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left:
Number of crayons Paul had left = 391
Number of erasers Paul had left = 38
To find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left, we need to subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons:
391 - 38 = 353
So, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers left at the end of the school year.
