Every shade adds depth and nuance: "The teacher wants to split the 56 students into 2 groups. The first group has 24 students, so there are 32 students left. To find out how many more students will be in the second group, we need to subtract the number of students in the first group from the total number of students. In this case, 32 students minus 24 students equals 8 students. So, there will be 8 more students in the second group."

prompted answer: evan has a large collection of books . he gave his best friend 14 books . he gave his little brother 8 books . now evan has 60 books in his collection . how many books did he have at first ?"Let's dive into this like a marine biologist exploring the ocean's depths: "Evan had a large collection of books at first.
Let's call the number of books he had at first x.
We know that he gave 14 books to his best friend, so the number of books he had left is x - 14.
He also gave 8 books to his little brother, so the number of books he had left is x - 14 - 8 = x - 22.
Now, we are told that Evan has 60 books in his collection. So, we can set up the equation: x - 22 = 60.
Solving for x, we get: x = 82.
So, Evan had 82 books in his collection at first!"

"If each shelf can hold 8 figures, then Mike needs 64 / 8 = 8 shelves."

Ð‰ï¿½ Shirley sold 54 boxes of Trefoils.
To find out how many cases of 6 boxes Shirley needs to deliver, we can divide the number of boxes she sold by the number of boxes in a case:
54 boxes / 6 boxes per case = 9 cases
So Shirley needs to deliver 9 cases of Trefoils.

prompted answer: paco had 17 cookies . he ate 14 cookies and gave 13 of them to his friend . how many more cookies did he eat than those he gave to his friend ?"Think of it as mixing colors for a painting. Every shade adds depth and nuance: "The more colors you use, the more interesting the painting will be." In this case, we are using different strategies to solve the problem, which will help us understand the concept better.
So, let's start with the information given in the problem:
Paco had 17 cookies.
He ate 14 cookies.
He gave 13 of them to his friend.
Now, let's analyze the information:
Paco had 17 cookies and ate 14 of them, so he had 17 - 14 = 3 remaining cookies.
He gave 13 of the cookies to his friend, so he had 3 - 13 = -10 cookies left.
Now, we need to find out how many more cookies Paco ate than the ones he gave to his friend.
To do this, we need to subtract the number of cookies he gave to his friend from the number of cookies he ate:
14 (cookies eaten) - 13 (cookies given to friend) = 1
So, Paco ate 1 more cookie than the ones he gave to his friend.
In summary, Paco ate 1 more cookie than the ones he gave to his friend.

prompted answer: the razorback shop makes $ 115 dollars off each jersey and $ 25 off each t-shirt . during the arkansas and texas tech game they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys . how much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "The razorback shop makes $115 for each jersey and $25 for each t-shirt."Let's assume that the number of jerseys sold is x.
We know that the total revenue from jerseys is $115x.
The total revenue from t-shirts is $25(113) = $2775.
So, the total revenue from both jerseys and t-shirts is $115x + $2775 = $2990.
Now, we want to find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt. Let's call the difference between the cost of a jersey and a t-shirt, "d".
We know that d is greater than 0 because the razorback shop makes more money from jerseys than from t-shirts.
We can set up the equation:
d = $115 - $25
d = $90
So, a jersey costs $90 more than a t-shirt.
Therefore, the answer is $90.

"If they sold 3867.0 tickets in the first half of the season, how many tickets did they sell in the second half?"To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of tickets sold in the first half from the total number of tickets sold last season. So, we subtract 3867.0 from 9570.0:9570.0 - 3867.0 = 5703.0 tickets sold in the second half of the season.Therefore, the Tigers sold 5703.0 tickets in the second half of the season.

A farmer estimates that he will harvest 48097.0 bushels of wheat. The weather is perfect during the growing season, so he harvests 684.0 bushels of wheat than expected. How many bushels of wheat does the farmer harvest?
To find the total number of bushels of wheat the farmer harvests, you need to add the expected harvest to the excess harvest.
Expected harvest = 48097.0 bushels
Excess harvest = 684.0 bushels
Total harvest = Expected harvest + Excess harvest
Total harvest = 48097.0 + 684.0 = 48781.0 bushels
So the farmer harvests 48781.0 bushels of wheat.

First, let's identify the information given in the problem:
1. Wendy bought 4.0 new chairs and 4.0 new tables.
2. She spent 6.0 minutes on each piece of furniture putting it together.
Now, let's calculate the total time it took Wendy to finish assembling all the furniture:
Total time = Number of pieces x Time per piece
= 4.0 chairs x 6.0 minutes/chair + 4.0 tables x 6.0 minutes/table
= 24.0 minutes + 24.0 minutes
= 48.0 minutes
Therefore, it took Wendy 48.0 minutes to finish assembling all the furniture.

If Katie scored 4.0 of the points and everyone else scored 4.0 points each, how many players were on her team?""
Answer:
Let's break this down step by step:
1. Katie scored 4.0 points out of the total 12.0 points scored by her team.
2. If everyone else scored 4.0 points each, then the total number of points scored by everyone else is 4.0 x (number of players - 1) = 4.0 x (n - 1).
3. Since Katie scored 4.0 points, the total number of points scored by her team is 4.0 + 4.0 = 8.0 points.
4. Therefore, the number of players on Katie's team is n = 8.0 / 4.0 = 2 players.
So, there were 2 players on Katie's team.

Does she have enough to make a pie ?"Let's dive into this like a marine biologist exploring the ocean's depths: "Tessa has 4.0 apples" - This is the starting point of our adventure. Tessa has 4.0 apples, which is a good amount for a snack or a small gathering, but not enough for a pie. "Anita gave her 5.0 more" - Ah, a generous friend indeed! Anita has added 5.0 more apples to Tessa's collection, bringing the total to 9.0 apples. "She needs 10.0 apples to make a pie" - This is the crucial piece of information that will determine whether Tessa can make a pie or not. If she has 9.0 apples, she is only 1.0 apple short of her goal. BUT WAIT, there's more! "Does she have enough to make a pie?" - This is the question that will keep us up at night, wondering if Tessa's apple collection is enough to create the delicious pie she desires. So, let's tally up the apples: 4.0 + 5.0 = 9.0 apples. Tessa has 9.0 apples, which is 1.0 apple short of the 10.0 apples she needs to make a pie. BUT WAIT, there's more! Tessa has 9.0 apples, which is still a respectable amount for a snack or a small gathering. So, while she may not have enough apples to make a pie, she still has a decent amount of apples to enjoy on their own or share with friends. And who knows, maybe Anita will give her even more apples in the future! The adventure may not be over yet.
