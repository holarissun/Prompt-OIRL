Every shade adds depth and nuance: "The little league stadium has 92 seats," you say. "And 47 people came to the game today." Ah, so there are 47 people in the stadium. "And 38 people were holding banners." That's a lot of banners! But wait, you said there were 92 seats. So, if 47 people are in the stadium, that means there are 45 empty seats. "But how many seats were empty?" you ask. Well, if there are 92 seats and 45 are empty, that means 47 people are sitting in the stadium, and 45 seats are empty. So, the answer is 45 empty seats."

question: paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies . he ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies . how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies did he eat ?
golden answer: 13.0
held-out prompt: "Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
prompted answer: paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies . he ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies . how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies did he eat ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "More" means "greater than". So, if paco ate more salty cookies than sweet cookies, that means he ate a quantity of salty cookies that is greater than the quantity of sweet cookies he ate.
Let's start by using the information given in the problem:
* Paco had 40 sweet cookies.
* Paco had 25 salty cookies.
* Paco ate 28 salty cookies.
* Paco ate 15 sweet cookies.
Now, let's use the word "more" to define the difference between the number of salty cookies Paco ate and the number of sweet cookies he ate:
More = (number of salty cookies ate) - (number of sweet cookies ate)
In this case, the number of salty cookies Paco ate is 28, and the number of sweet cookies he ate is 15, so:
More = 28 - 15 = 13
Therefore, Paco ate 13 more salty cookies than sweet cookies.

prompted answer: jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover her room . if her room is 2 feet wide what is the length of her room ?"It's like mining for gems; we dig deep, assessing each discovery: "What is the length of Jesse's room?"We can start by using the information given in the problem.
The size of the carpet Jesse needs is 10 square feet.
The width of Jesse's room is 2 feet.
So, we can start by finding the length of the room by dividing the size of the carpet by the width of the room:
10 square feet / 2 feet = 5 feet
Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 5 feet.

prompted answer: the razorback shop makes $ 192 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 34 off each jersey . during the arkansas and texas tech game they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys . how much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey ?"Envision ourselves as geologists, studying layers of rock. Layer by layer, we analyze: "The Arkansas Razorback Shop makes $192 off each t-shirt and $34 off each jersey." We record this information in our notes.Next, we observe: "During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys." We calculate: "To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we need to subtract the cost of a jersey from the cost of a t-shirt." We solve: "The cost of a t-shirt is $192, and the cost of a jersey is $34. To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we subtract $34 from $192: $192 - $34 = $158." Therefore, a t-shirt costs $158 more than a jersey."In this scenario, the t-shirt costs $158 more than the jersey.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pencils that Faye has. Let's break down the information given in the problem:
1. Faye has 6 packs of pencils.
2. Each pack has 14 pencils.
So, the total number of pencils Faye has is:
6 packs x 14 pencils/pack = 84 pencils
Therefore, Faye has 84 pencils in total.

A farmer estimates that he will harvest 48097.0 bushels of wheat. The weather is perfect during the growing season, so he harvests 684.0 bushels of wheat than expected. How many bushels of wheat does the farmer harvest?
To find the total number of bushels of wheat the farmer harvests, you need to add the expected harvest to the excess harvest.
Expected harvest = 48097.0 bushels
Excess harvest = 684.0 bushels
Total harvest = Expected harvest + Excess harvest
Total harvest = 48097.0 + 684.0 = 48781.0 bushels
So the farmer harvests 48781.0 bushels of wheat.

Answer: Let's break this down step by step:

Wendy bought 4.0 new chairs and 4.0 new tables for her house.
If she spent 6.0 minutes on each piece of furniture putting it together, then the total time it took her to finish assembling all the furniture is:
4.0 chairs x 6.0 minutes/chair = 24.0 minutes
4.0 tables x 6.0 minutes/table = 24.0 minutes
Adding the time for both chairs and tables, we get:
24.0 minutes + 24.0 minutes = 48.0 minutes
Therefore, it took Wendy 48.0 minutes to finish assembling all the furniture.

Answer:
You walked a total distance of 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 mile.

Explanation:
To find the total distance you walked, you need to add the two distances you provided: 0.75 miles + 0.25 miles = 1 mile. So, you walked a total distance of 1 mile.

"Ah, I see," said the math teacher, "let's see if we can find the answer to the second question first. If Jenny ran 0.6 mile and walked 0.4 mile, that means she walked 0.4 mile less than she ran. So, the distance Jenny ran is 0.6 mile - 0.4 mile = 0.2 mile."
"Now, let's find out how much farther Jenny ran than she walked. To do this, we need to subtract the distance she walked from the distance she ran. So, 0.2 mile - 0.4 mile = 0.2 mile. Therefore, Jenny ran 0.2 mile farther than she walked."
"Great job, class!" exclaimed the teacher. "You've solved the problem with ease. Keep up the good work!"

Explanation:

To find the total number of bananas in the pile, we need to add the number of bananas in the original pile (2.0) to the number of bananas added to the pile (7.0).
2.0 + 7.0 = 9.0
So, there are 9 bananas in the pile.

"She wants to have 25 seashells in her collection." Okay, that's also a given.
"So, how many more seashells does she need to find?"
To find out, we need to subtract the number of seashells Megan already has (19) from the number she wants to have (25):
19 - 25 = -6
So, Megan needs to find 6 more seashells to have 25 in her collection.
Therefore, the answer is 6.
