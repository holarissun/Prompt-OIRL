How many Skittles does Kimberly have in all ?"This is like a game of chess, anticipating each move ahead: "Kimberly has 5.0 Skittles. She buys 7.0 more. Later, Kimberly buys 18.0 oranges at the store. How many Skittles does Kimberly have in all?"
Answer:
Kimberly has 5.0 Skittles initially.
When she buys 7.0 more Skittles, she now has 5 + 7 = 12 Skittles.
Later, when she buys 18.0 oranges at the store, she does not gain or lose any Skittles, as oranges are not part of the Skittle count.
Therefore, Kimberly has 12 Skittles in all.

prompted answer: There was a stack of 700.0 sheets of used paper . Lexie wants to place it in boxes for recycling . If every box can contain 100.0 sheets , how many boxes does Lexie need ?"This is like a pot of stew, simmering to meld the flavors: "Lexie wants to place it in boxes for recycling. If every box can contain 100.0 sheets, how many boxes does Lexie need?"
To find out how many boxes Lexie needs, we need to divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets that each box can hold. In this case, the total number of sheets is 700.0, and each box can hold 100.0 sheets, so:
700.0 ÷ 100.0 = 7 boxes
Therefore, Lexie needs 7 boxes to place the stack of used paper in for recycling.

If each piece of bulk candy costs 8.0 cents , how many gumdrops can I buy ?"This is like a game of chess, anticipating each move ahead: "To find out how many gumdrops you can buy, we need to divide the amount of money you have by the cost of each piece of candy. In this case, you have 224.0 cents and each piece of bulk candy costs 8.0 cents. So, you can buy: 224.0 cents ÷ 8.0 cents = 28 pieces of bulk candy. Since gumdrops are a type of bulk candy, you can buy 28 gumdrops."

If she had 5.0 shelves of mystery books and 3.0 shelves of picture books , how many books did she have total ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
Step 1: Gwen has 5 shelves of mystery books, so the total number of mystery books is 5 x 4 = 20.
Step 2: Gwen has 3 shelves of picture books, so the total number of picture books is 3 x 4 = 12.

prompted answer: If Anne wandered for 3.0 hours at 2.0 miles per hour . How far did Anne go ?"Like an athlete training for an event, every exercise has a purpose: "Anne wandered" means that she was not following a specific route or schedule, but rather moving around freely. The distance she traveled can be calculated by multiplying the time she wandered by her speed: distance = time x speed. In this case, Anne wandered for 3.0 hours, so the distance she traveled is: distance = 3.0 hours x 2.0 miles/hour = 6.0 miles. So, Anne went 6.0 miles while wandering.

The trivia team had 9.0 members total.2. During the game, 3.0 members did not show up.3. Each member that did show up scored 2.0 points.Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the total number of points scored:Since 3.0 members did not show up, the total number of members that did show up is 9.0 - 3.0 = 6.0 members.Since each member that did show up scored 2.0 points, the total number of points scored by the 6.0 members that did show up is 6.0 x 2.0 = 12.0 points.So, the total number of points scored by the trivia team is 12.0 points.Therefore, the answer to the question "How many points were scored total?" is 12.0 points.

To find out how many cases Karen picks up from the Cookie Mom, we need to divide the number of boxes Karen sold by the number of boxes in a case.
1 case = 12.0 boxes
So, Karen sold 36.0 boxes, and she picks up 36 / 12 = 3 cases from the Cookie Mom.

prompted answer: A construction company is repaving a damaged road . So far , they have repaved a total of 4938.0 inches of the road . Today , they repaved 805.0 inches of the road . How many inches of the road had they repaved before today ?"Like a bee pollinating flowers, let's gather the essence from each point: "So far, they have repaved a total of 4938.0 inches of the road." This means that the total distance repaved so far is 4938.0 inches. "Today, they repaved 805.0 inches of the road." This means that the distance repaved today is 805.0 inches. To find out how many inches of the road had been repaved before today, we need to subtract the distance repaved today from the total distance repaved so far: 4938.0 - 805.0 = 4133.0 inches. So, before today, the construction company had repaved 4133.0 inches of the road.

prompted answer: Paige had 8.0 songs on her mp3 player . If she deleted 5.0 old songs from it and then added 30.0 new songs , how many songs does she have on her mp3 player ?"It's like mining for gems; we dig deep, assessing each discovery: "Is this a diamond in the rough, or just a pebble?" We carefully evaluate each piece of data, analyzing it for its potential to reveal new insights or solve complex problems.
To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the passage:
* Paige had 8.0 songs on her mp3 player.
* She deleted 5.0 old songs from it.
* She added 30.0 new songs to it.
We can start by subtracting the number of old songs she deleted from the total number of songs she had:
8.0 - 5.0 = 3.0
So, Paige now has 3.0 songs on her mp3 player.
Next, we can add the number of new songs she added to the total number of songs she had:
3.0 + 30.0 = 33.0
So, Paige now has 33.0 songs on her mp3 player.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 33.0 songs.

prompted answer: Haley 's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4.0 dollars each . Haley bought 3.0 tickets for herself and her friends and 5.0 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go . How much did she spend ?"Imagine we're in a lab, every test and observation is crucial for the conclusion: "How much did Haley spend?" Let's analyze the information given:

1. Haley bought 3.0 tickets for herself and her friends.
Tickets cost 4.0 dollars each, so Haley spent 3 x 4 = 12.0 dollars on tickets for herself and her friends.
2. Haley bought 5.0 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.
Tickets cost 4.0 dollars each, so Haley spent 5 x 4 = 20.0 dollars on extra tickets.
Now, let's calculate the total amount Haley spent:
Total amount = 12.0 + 20.0 = 32.0 dollars.
Therefore, Haley spent 32.0 dollars on tickets for herself and her friends, and extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.
