prompted answer: A store had 40.0 oranges in a bin . If they threw away 37.0 of the old ones and put 7.0 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Oranges in the bin" can be categorized under "Quantities" and "New oranges" can be categorized under "Addition."Now, let's solve the problem:The original number of oranges in the bin was 40.0 oranges.This means that the quantity of oranges in the bin before any changes was 40.0.Now, the problem states that 37.0 of the old oranges were thrown away, which means that the quantity of oranges in the bin after the old oranges were thrown away is:40.0 - 37.0 = 3.0 oranges.Finally, the problem states that 7.0 new oranges were added to the bin, which means that the updated quantity of oranges in the bin is:3.0 + 7.0 = 10.0 oranges.Therefore, there are 10.0 oranges in the bin after the changes.
