prompted answer: ned gave away 13 of his video games to a friend . now ned has 6 games . how many games did ned have before he gave the games away ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "Before Ned gave away 13 games, he had 6 games."This is the given information:Ned had 6 games before he gave away 13 games.
So, if Ned had 6 games before he gave away 13 games, then he had 6 + 13 = 19 games in total before he gave away any games.

prompted answer: a waiter had 62 customers in his section . if 17 of them left and the rest of his tables had 9 people at each table how many tables did he have ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "Step 1: We know that the waiter had 62 customers in his section.
Step 2: We are told that 17 of them left. So, the number of customers the waiter had left = 62 - 17 = 45.
Step 3: We are also told that the rest of his tables had 9 people at each table. So, the total number of tables the waiter had = 45 / 9 = 5 tables.
Therefore, the waiter had 5 tables in his section.
So, the answer is 5 tables.

question: baker made 144 cakes . he sold 71 of them . then he made 111 more cakes . how many more cakes did baker make than those he sold ?
golden answer: 184.0
held-out prompt: "Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
prompted answer: baker made 144 cakes . he sold 71 of them . then he made 111 more cakes . how many more cakes did baker make than those he sold ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "More" means "greater than". So, if Baker made more cakes than he sold, that means he made cakes that he did not sell.
In the first part of the problem, the baker made 144 cakes and sold 71 of them, so he had 73 cakes left (144 - 71 = 73).
In the second part of the problem, the baker made 111 more cakes, bringing the total number of cakes he made to 144 + 111 = 255 cakes.
Now, we need to find out how many more cakes the baker made than he sold. To do this, we subtract the number of cakes he sold (71) from the total number of cakes he made (255):
255 - 71 = 184
So, the baker made 184 more cakes than he sold.

prompted answer: the razorback shop makes $ 115 dollars off each jersey and $ 25 off each t-shirt . during the arkansas and texas tech game they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys . how much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "The razorback shop makes $115 for each jersey and $25 for each t-shirt."Let's assume that the number of jerseys sold is x.
We know that the total revenue from jerseys is $115x.
The total revenue from t-shirts is $25(113) = $2775.
So, the total revenue from both jerseys and t-shirts is $115x + $2775 = $2990.
Now, we want to find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt. Let's call the difference between the cost of a jersey and a t-shirt, "d".
We know that d is greater than 0 because the razorback shop makes more money from jerseys than from t-shirts.
We can set up the equation:
d = $115 - $25
d = $90
So, a jersey costs $90 more than a t-shirt.
Therefore, the answer is $90.

prompted answer: James rode 80.0 miles at 16.0 miles per hour . How long did James ride ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "James rode 80.0 miles" means that James traveled a distance of 80.0 miles. "James rode at a speed of 16.0 miles per hour" means that James traveled that distance in a time of 80.0 miles / 16.0 miles per hour = 5 hours.So, James rode for 5 hours.

prompted answer: A new building needed 14.0 windows . The builder had already installed 5.0 of them . If it takes 4.0 hours to install each window , how long will it take him to install the rest ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "The builder has already installed 5.0 windows, which means he has 9.0 windows left to install (14.0 - 5.0 = 9.0)."Now, we know that it takes 4.0 hours to install each window, so the total time it will take the builder to install the remaining 9.0 windows is:9.0 windows x 4.0 hours/window = 36.0 hoursIn other words, it will take the builder 36.0 hours to install the rest of the windows.

prompted answer: Luke was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3.0 on each page . If he had 3.0 new cards and 9.0 old cards to put in the binder , how many pages would he use ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
Step 1: Define the problem. We are given that Luke has 3.0 new cards and 9.0 old cards to put in his binder.
Step 2: Determine the total number of cards Luke has. The sum of the new cards (3.0) and the old cards (9.0) is 12.0 cards.
Step 3: Divide the total number of cards by the number of pages in the binder. Since Luke is using a binder with 3.0 cards per page, we can divide the total number of cards (12.0) by 3.0 to get the number of pages needed:
12.0 cards ÷ 3.0 pages per page = 4 pages
Therefore, Luke would use 4 pages in his binder to organize his baseball cards.

Step 1: Identify the given information:
* The trivia team had 5.0 members total.
* 2.0 members did not show up.
* Each member that did show up scored 6.0 points.
Step 2: Use the information provided to find the total number of members that showed up:
* Total number of members = 5.0 - 2.0 = 3.0
Step 3: Find the total number of points scored by the members who showed up:
* Total points scored = 3.0 x 6.0 = 18.0
Therefore, the trivia team scored 18.0 points in the game.

prompted answer: Sam had to wash 40.0 short sleeve shirts and 23.0 long sleeve shirts before school . If he had only washed 29.0 of them by the time school started , how many did he not wash ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
Let S be the set of all shirts that Sam washed before school.
We know that S contains 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts, for a total of 63 shirts in S.
We are given that Sam did not wash 29 shirts by the time school started.
So, the number of shirts that Sam did not wash is 29 - 63 = -34 shirts.
Therefore, Sam did not wash 34 shirts before school.
Note: This solution assumes that the information given in the problem is accurate and complete. If there are any errors or omissions in the information, the solution may not be valid."

prompted answer: there are 40 students in the school band . if the band instructor put the students into rows with 5 students in each row how many rows could he make ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "1.
Step 1: Define the problem.
The problem states that there are 40 students in the school band, and the band instructor wants to put them into rows with 5 students in each row.
Step 2: Identify the given information.
We are given that there are 40 students in the band and that the instructor wants to put them into rows with 5 students in each row.
Step 3: Determine the number of rows that can be made.
To determine the number of rows that can be made, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students in each row. In this case, we have 40 students / 5 students per row = 8 rows.
So, the band instructor could make 8 rows with 5 students in each row.
Therefore, the answer to the problem is 8 rows.
