This is the starting point, the foundation of the problem. "He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove, baseball, and bat." This is the additional information that we need to use to solve the problem. "He had 32.0 dollars over." This is the remaining amount of money that Benny has after buying the baseball gear.So, to find out how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we need to subtract the amount he had over from the total amount he received for his birthday: 79.0 - 32.0 = 47.0 dollars.So, Benny spent 47.0 dollars on the baseball gear.

prompted answer: If Anne wandered for 3.0 hours at 2.0 miles per hour . How far did Anne go ?"Like an athlete training for an event, every exercise has a purpose: "Anne wandered" means that she was not following a specific route or schedule, but rather moving around freely. The distance she traveled can be calculated by multiplying the time she wandered by her speed: distance = time x speed. In this case, Anne wandered for 3.0 hours, so the distance she traveled is: distance = 3.0 hours x 2.0 miles/hour = 6.0 miles. So, Anne went 6.0 miles while wandering.

prompted answer: A fruit farm packs oranges in boxes that hold 10.0 each . One day it packs 2650.0 oranges . How many boxes did they use ?"Envision this as a mosaic. Each tile contributes to the final artwork: "How many boxes did they use?" The tiles are: 10.0, 2650.0, and the number of boxes. To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boxes used by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges each box can hold. So, we divide 2650.0 by 10.0: 2650.0 ÷ 10.0 = 265 boxes. Therefore, they used 265 boxes to pack the oranges.

Each step, from soil preparation to watering, matters: "The number of baggies Olivia can make depends on the number of cookies she has."
Answer:
Olivia can make 4 baggies of cookies.

Explanation:
To find out how many baggies Olivia can make, we need to divide the total number of cookies she has by the number of cookies in each bag. Since there are 9.0 cookies in each bag, we can divide the total number of cookies by 9:
13.0 + 41.0 = 54.0
54.0 ÷ 9.0 = 6
So, Olivia can make 6 baggies of cookies.
