golden answer: 28.0

prompted answer: jake has 11 fewer peaches than steven . if jake has 17 peaches . how many peaches does steven have ?"Like a bee pollinating flowers, let's gather the essence from each point: "Jake has 11 fewer peaches than Steven." Let's represent this as "Jake has x peaches, and Steven has x - 11 peaches."Now, we are given that Jake has 17 peaches.
So, we can set up the equation:
Jake has x peaches = 17
Now, we can use the information that Jake has 11 fewer peaches than Steven to solve for Steven's peaches:
Steven has x - 11 peaches = Jake's peaches (17)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Steven has x = 28
So, Steven has 28 peaches.
