prompted answer: Megan had 40.0 homework problems . She finished 26.0 of them but still had 2.0 pages of problems to do . If each page has the same number of problems on it , how many problems are on each page ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
Step 1: Read the problem carefully.
The problem states that Megan has 40.0 homework problems and she finished 26.0 of them. This means that she still has 14.0 problems to do.
Step 2: Use the information given in the problem to find out how many problems are on each page.
Since Megan has 14.0 problems left to do, and each page has the same number of problems, we can divide the number of problems left to do by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page:
14.0 problems / 2.0 pages = 7.0 problems per page
So, there are 7.0 problems on each page.
Therefore, the answer to the problem is 7.0 problems per page.

prompted answer: Mike had 15.0 video games but 9.0 of them were n't working . If he wanted to sell the working games for $ 5.0 each , how much money could he earn ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "The information given in the problem is:Mike has 15.0 video games but 9.0 of them weren't working. If he wanted to sell the working games for $ 5.0 each, how much money could he earn?"Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem. We are given:1. The number of video games Mike has: 15.02. The number of non-working video games: 9.03. The price at which Mike wants to sell the working video games: $ 5.0Step 2: Identify what we want to find out. We want to find out how much money Mike could earn if he sells the working video games.Step 3: Use the information given in the problem to find the number of working video games Mike has. We are told that 9.0 of the video games are non-working, so the number of working video games is 15.0 - 9.0 = 6.0Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Mike could earn if he sells all the working video games. Since he has 6.0 working video games, and he wants to sell each one for $ 5.0, the total amount of money he could earn is 6.0 x $ 5.0 = $ 30.0Step 5: Check our answer. Let's make sure that $ 30.0 is a reasonable amount of money for Mike to earn. If he sells each of his 6.0 working video games for $ 5.0, he will earn a total of $ 6.0 x 6.0 = $ 36.0, which is close to $ 30.0. So, our answer is reasonable.Therefore, if Mike wants to sell the working video games for $ 5.0 each, he could earn $ 30.0.

question: Mikey had 356.0 leaves . Some of her leaves blew away . Now she has 112.0 leaves left . How many of her leaves blew away ?
golden answer: 244.0
held-out prompt: "Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
prompted answer: Mikey had 356.0 leaves . Some of her leaves blew away . Now she has 112.0 leaves left . How many of her leaves blew away ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
Step 1: We are given that Mikey had 356.0 leaves.
Step 2: We are told that some of her leaves blew away.
Step 3: We are asked to find out how many leaves blew away.
Step 4: We can start by subtracting the number of leaves Mikey has left (112.0) from the number of leaves she had initially (356.0).
So, the number of leaves that blew away is:
356.0 - 112.0 = 244.0
Therefore, 244 leaves blew away.
"Now, let's check our answer:
If 244 leaves blew away, then Mikey had 356.0 - 244.0 = 112.0 leaves left.
And indeed, we are told that Mikey has 112.0 leaves left.
So, our answer is correct! We have successfully solved the problem.
"In conclusion, we have shown that 244 leaves blew away from Mikey's tree. We hope this solution helps you understand the problem better and build your problem-solving skills."

prompted answer: In a video game , each enemy defeated gives you 5.0 points . If a level has 8.0 enemies total and you destroy all but 6.0 of them , how many points would you earn ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
Step 1: Identify the given information.
* In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 5.0 points.
* There are 8.0 enemies in total in the level.
* You defeat all but 6.0 of them.
Step 2: Calculate the total number of points you earn from defeating all the enemies.
* Total number of enemies = 8.0
* Number of enemies you defeat = 8.0 - 6.0 = 2.0
* Total points earned = 5.0 x 2.0 = 10.0 points
Step 3: Confirm your answer.
* The question asks how many points you would earn if you defeat all but 6.0 of the enemies in the level.

prompted answer: Robin was making baggies of cookies with 6.0 cookies in each bag . If she had 23.0 chocolate chip cookies and 25.0 oatmeal cookies , how many baggies could she make ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
First, we know that Robin can make baggies of cookies with 6.0 cookies in each bag. So, if she has 23.0 chocolate chip cookies, she can make 23/6 = 3.83 baggies of chocolate chip cookies.
Similarly, if she has 25.0 oatmeal cookies, she can make 25/6 = 4.17 baggies of oatmeal cookies.
Now, we add the number of baggies she can make of each type of cookie: 3.83 + 4.17 = 7.99 baggies.
So, Robin can make 7.99 baggies of cookies in total."
This solution is correct, but it's a bit wordy and could be simplified. Here's a more concise way to solve the problem:
Let's say Robin can make baggies of cookies with 6.0 cookies in each bag. If she has 23.0 chocolate chip cookies and 25.0 oatmeal cookies, she can make:
23 / 6 = 3.83 baggies of chocolate chip cookies
25 / 6 = 4.17 baggies of oatmeal cookies
Total number of baggies = 3.83 + 4.17 = 8 baggies
So, Robin can make 8 baggies of cookies in total.

First, we know that Olivia has 13.0 chocolate chip cookies and 41.0 oatmeal cookies. Let's call the total number of cookies she has:
13.0 + 41.0 = 54.0
Now, we know that each baggie of cookies contains 9.0 cookies. So, to find out how many baggies Olivia can make, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each baggie:
54.0 ÷ 9.0 = 6
So, Olivia can make 6 baggies of cookies.
Therefore, the answer is 6 baggies of cookies that Olivia can make."

If the coach put them into groups with 6.0 players in each group, how many groups would there be?"
To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of players (48.0 + 6.0 = 54.0) by the number of players in each group (6.0).
So, there would be 54.0 / 6.0 = 9 groups of players.
Therefore, there would be 9 groups of players.
