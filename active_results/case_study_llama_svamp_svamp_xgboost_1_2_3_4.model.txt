prompted answer: tom bought 63 tickets at the state fair . he spent 14 tickets at the 'dunk a clown ' booth and decided to use the rest on rides . if each ride cost 7 tickets how many rides could he go on ?"Like a bee pollinating flowers, let's gather the essence from each point: "Tom bought 63 tickets at the state fair." (1) "He spent 14 tickets at the 'Dunk a Clown' booth." (2) "And decided to use the rest on rides." (3) "If each ride cost 7 tickets, how many rides could he go on?"Now, let's combine these points to solve the problem:1.
Total tickets Tom had: 63
Tickets spent at 'Dunk a Clown' booth: 14
Tickets left for rides: 63 - 14 = 50
Each ride costs 7 tickets, so:
Number of rides Tom could go on: 50 / 7 = 7
Tom could go on 7 rides with the remaining tickets.

prompted answer: jake has 11 fewer peaches than steven . if jake has 17 peaches . how many peaches does steven have ?"Like a bee pollinating flowers, let's gather the essence from each point: "Jake has 11 fewer peaches than Steven." Let's represent this as "Jake has x peaches, and Steven has x - 11 peaches."Now, we are given that Jake has 17 peaches.
So, we can set up the equation:
Jake has x peaches = 17
Now, we can use the information that Jake has 11 fewer peaches than Steven to solve for Steven's peaches:
Steven has x - 11 peaches = Jake's peaches (17)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Steven has x = 28
So, Steven has 28 peaches.
