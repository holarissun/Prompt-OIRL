To determine how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give to each block, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of blocks he needs to deliver to.
Let's assume the mailman needs to deliver the junk mail to 4 blocks.
So, to calculate the number of pieces of junk mail each block should receive, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail (192) by the number of blocks (4):
192 ÷ 4 = 48
So, each block should receive 48 pieces of junk mail.

Љ�
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:
1. There were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase initially.
2. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden.
3. There are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase.
Now, let's analyze the information:
1. The number of roses in the vase increased from 5 to 12.
2. The number of orchids in the vase increased from 3 to 2.
So, the difference between the number of roses and orchids in the vase now is:
12 - 2 = 10
There are 10 more roses than orchids in the vase now.

Љ Nell has 404 baseball cards and 495 10 cards. "
Step 1: We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 10 cards initially.
Step 2: We are given that she gave some of her cards to Jeff.
Step 3: We know that Nell now has 404 baseball cards and 495 10 cards.
Step 4: We want to find out how many more 10 cards than baseball cards Nell has.
So, let's subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of cards:
495 (10 cards) - 404 (baseball cards) = 91
Therefore, Nell has 91 more 10 cards than baseball cards.
So, the answer is 91.

prompted answer: faye had 31 packs of pencils each one having 6 pencils . she was placing her pencils into rows with 19 pencils in each row . how many pencils does she have ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "1.
Step 1: Understand the problem statement. We are given that Faye has 31 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 6 pencils. We are also told that Faye is placing her pencils into rows, with 19 pencils in each row.
Step 2: Identify the relevant information. We know that Faye has 31 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 6 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils Faye has is:
31 packs x 6 pencils per pack = 186 pencils
We also know that Faye is placing her pencils into rows, with 19 pencils in each row. So, the total number of rows of pencils Faye has is:
186 pencils / 19 pencils per row = 9 rows of pencils
Step 3: Conclude the answer. Therefore, Faye has 9 rows of pencils, with 19 pencils in each row. In total, Faye has 186 pencils.

prompted answer: Kaleb had 10.0 video games but 8.0 of them were n't working . If he wanted to sell the working games for $ 6.0 each , how much money could he earn ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "The problem states that Kaleb has 10.0 video games but 8.0 of them are not working. We are asked to find out how much money Kaleb could earn if he sells the working games for $6.0 each.
Step 1: Identify the number of working video games that Kaleb has.
From the problem, we know that 8.0 of Kaleb's video games are not working, which means that the number of working video games he has is 10.0 - 8.0 = 2.0.
Step 2: Find out how much money Kaleb could earn from selling the working video games.
If Kaleb sells each of his 2.0 working video games for $6.0, he will earn a total of 2.0 x $6.0 = $12.0.
Therefore, Kaleb could earn $12.0 by selling the working video games.
Conclusion: Kaleb could earn $12.0 by selling the working video games."

prompted answer: A store had 40.0 oranges in a bin . If they threw away 37.0 of the old ones and put 7.0 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Oranges in the bin" can be categorized under "Quantities" and "New oranges" can be categorized under "Addition."Now, let's solve the problem:The original number of oranges in the bin was 40.0 oranges.This means that the quantity of oranges in the bin before any changes was 40.0.Now, the problem states that 37.0 of the old oranges were thrown away, which means that the quantity of oranges in the bin after the old oranges were thrown away is:40.0 - 37.0 = 3.0 oranges.Finally, the problem states that 7.0 new oranges were added to the bin, which means that the updated quantity of oranges in the bin is:3.0 + 7.0 = 10.0 oranges.Therefore, there are 10.0 oranges in the bin after the changes.
