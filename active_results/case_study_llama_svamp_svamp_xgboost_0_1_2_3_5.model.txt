96 seconds - 88 seconds = 8 seconds
So, it took Todd 8 fewer seconds to run around the track than it took Brian.

prompted answer: faye was placing her pencils into rows with 8 pencils in each row . if she had 32 pencils how many rows could she make ?"Think of it as mixing colors for a painting. Every shade adds depth and nuance: "The more colors you use, the more vibrant and interesting the painting will be." Similarly, the more rows Faye creates, the more organized and visually appealing her pencils will be. So, if Faye has 32 pencils, she could make 4 rows of 8 pencils each. That's 32 pencils divided by 8 pencils per row equals 4 rows.

prompted answer: faye picked 88 flowers for her friend 's wedding . she was making bouquets with 5 flowers in each one . if 48 of the flowers wilted before the wedding how many bouquets could she still make ?"Imagine it as an echo in a valley, every sound has an origin and meaning: "Faye picked 88 flowers for her friend's wedding.
She was making bouquets with 5 flowers in each one. If 48 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?"
Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:
1. Faye picked 88 flowers for her friend's wedding.
2. She was making bouquets with 5 flowers in each one.
3. 48 of the flowers wilted before the wedding.
Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the answer to the question. Since Faye picked 88 flowers, and she was making bouquets with 5 flowers in each one, that means she could make 88 / 5 = 17.6 bouquets.
However, we are told that 48 of the flowers wilted before the wedding. This means that the number of flowers available for making bouquets is now 88 - 48 = 40.
So, Faye could still make 40 / 5 = 8 bouquets.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 8 bouquets.

Љ� The clues:
1. "6 birds and 3 storks were sitting on the fence." (Clue #1)
2. "2 more storks came to join them." (Clue #2)
Now, let's analyze the clues:
Clue #1 tells us that there are 6 birds and 3 storks already sitting on the fence.
Clue #2 tells us that 2 more storks came to join them, which means there are now 3 + 2 = 5 storks on the fence.
So, the number of storks on the fence is 5.
Now, let's find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence:
6 birds (from Clue #1) - 5 storks (from Clue #2) = 1 more bird than stork.
Therefore, there is 1 more bird than stork sitting on the fence.
The answer to the mystery is: 1 more bird than stork.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:
* Paul received a box of 531 crayons.
* He had 38 erasers.
* At the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left.
* He did not lose any erasers.
Now, let's use the information to find the answer to the question: How many more crayons than erasers did Paul have left?
To do this, we need to subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons Paul had at the end of the school year:
391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers) = 353
So, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers left at the end of the school year.

Љ� Paul had 601 crayons and 406 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had 336 left. To find out how many more erasers than crayons he had left, we need to subtract the number of erasers he had at the end of the school year from the total number of erasers he had at the beginning of the school year.
So, the number of erasers he had left over is:
406 - 336 = 70
Therefore, Paul had 70 more erasers than crayons left at the end of the school year.

2. She was making bouquets with 5 flowers in each one.
3. 48 of the flowers wilted before the wedding.
Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the answer to the question. Since Faye picked 88 flowers, and she was making bouquets with 5 flowers in each one, that means she could make 88 / 5 = 17.6 bouquets.
However, we are told that 48 of the flowers wilted before the wedding. This means that the number of flowers available for making bouquets is now 88 - 48 = 40.
So, Faye could still make 40 / 5 = 8 bouquets.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 8 bouquets.

Љ� Paul had 601 crayons and 406 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had 336 left. To find out how many more erasers than crayons he had left, we need to subtract the number of erasers he had at the end of the school year from the total number of erasers he had at the beginning of the school year.
So, the number of erasers he had left over is:
406 - 336 = 70
Therefore, Paul had 70 more erasers than crayons left at the end of the school year.

So, we know that the length of the carpet is 10 feet. But how wide is the room? We're told that the room is 2 feet wide.
So, the length of the room is 10 feet / 2 feet = 5 feet.
Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 5 feet."

Every shade adds depth and nuance: "Katie's team won their dodgeball game and scored 12.0 points total. If Katie scored 4.0 of the points and everyone else scored 4.0 points each, how many players were on her team?""
Answer:
Let's break this down step by step:
1. Katie scored 4.0 points out of the total 12.0 points scored by her team.
2. If everyone else scored 4.0 points each, then the total number of points scored by everyone else is 4.0 x (number of players - 1) = 4.0 x (n - 1).
3. Since Katie scored 4.0 points, the total number of points scored by her team is 4.0 + 4.0 = 8.0 points.
4. Therefore, the number of players on Katie's team is n = 8.0 / 4.0 = 2 players.
So, there were 2 players on Katie's team.
