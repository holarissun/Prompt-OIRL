prompted answer: brian ran around the school track in 96 seconds . todd ran around it in 88 seconds . how many fewer seconds did it take todd to run around the tracl ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Brian ran around the school track in 96 seconds" and "Todd ran around it in 88 seconds."Now, to find out how many fewer seconds it took Todd to run around the track, we need to subtract the time it took Brian to run around the track from the time it took Todd to run around the track.
96 seconds - 88 seconds = 8 seconds
So, it took Todd 8 fewer seconds to run around the track than it took Brian.

To determine how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give to each block, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of blocks he needs to deliver to.
Let's assume the mailman needs to deliver the junk mail to 4 blocks.
So, to calculate the number of pieces of junk mail each block should receive, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail (192) by the number of blocks (4):
192 รท 4 = 48
So, each block should receive 48 pieces of junk mail.

prompted answer: a chef used 39 cherries to make a pie . now he has 58 cherries left . how many cherries did he have before he made the pie ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Before Making the Pie" = 39 cherries"After Making the Pie" = 58 cherriesNow, let's solve the problem:Before making the pie, the chef had 39 cherries.
Let's assume the chef had x cherries before making the pie.
After making the pie, the chef has 58 cherries left.
So, the difference between the number of cherries the chef had before making the pie and the number of cherries he has after making the pie is:
x - 58 = 39
Now, we can solve for x:
x = 97
So, the chef had 97 cherries before making the pie.

golden answer: 184.0
held-out prompt: "Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "
prompted answer: baker made 144 cakes . he sold 71 of them . then he made 111 more cakes . how many more cakes did baker make than those he sold ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "More" means "greater than". So, if Baker made more cakes than he sold, that means he made cakes that he did not sell.
In the first part of the problem, the baker made 144 cakes and sold 71 of them, so he had 73 cakes left (144 - 71 = 73).
In the second part of the problem, the baker made 111 more cakes, bringing the total number of cakes he made to 144 + 111 = 255 cakes.
Now, we need to find out how many more cakes the baker made than he sold. To do this, we subtract the number of cakes he sold (71) from the total number of cakes he made (255):
255 - 71 = 184
So, the baker made 184 more cakes than he sold.

prompted answer: paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday . at the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers . how many more crayons than erasers did he have left ?"As a librarian categorizes books, let's sort the information accordingly: "Crayons" and "Erasers" are two separate categories.
Crayons:
* Number of crayons Paul received: 531
* Number of crayons Paul had left at the end of the school year: 391
Erasers:
* Number of erasers Paul received: 38
* Number of erasers Paul had left at the end of the school year: 38
Now, let's find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left:
Number of crayons Paul had left = 391
Number of erasers Paul had left = 38
To find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left, we need to subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons:
391 - 38 = 353
So, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers left at the end of the school year.

The Razorback shop makes $76 per jersey and $204 per t-shirt.
During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 2 jerseys and 158 t-shirts.
To find out how much money the Razorback shop made from selling jerseys, we need to multiply the number of jerseys sold by the price per jersey:
2 jerseys x $76 per jersey = $152
So, the Razorback shop made $152 from selling jerseys during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.

prompted answer: the razorback shop makes $ 115 dollars off each jersey and $ 25 off each t-shirt . during the arkansas and texas tech game they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys . how much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt ?"Let's approach this like a mathematician proving a theorem, step by logical step: "The razorback shop makes $115 for each jersey and $25 for each t-shirt."Let's assume that the number of jerseys sold is x.
We know that the total revenue from jerseys is $115x.
The total revenue from t-shirts is $25(113) = $2775.
So, the total revenue from both jerseys and t-shirts is $115x + $2775 = $2990.
Now, we want to find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt. Let's call the difference between the cost of a jersey and a t-shirt, "d".
We know that d is greater than 0 because the razorback shop makes more money from jerseys than from t-shirts.
We can set up the equation:
d = $115 - $25
d = $90
So, a jersey costs $90 more than a t-shirt.
Therefore, the answer is $90.
